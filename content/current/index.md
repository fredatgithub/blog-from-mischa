## Weight Loss

I've been on a weight loss regime sinds late 2021. I've maintained a caloric deficit since I started, but in some periods life got in the way and I had breaks from the caloric deficit. 

See:

[üçé My Weight Loss Journey And Current Goal üìâ](/zet/weight-loss-journey/)

### Diet

I eat a whole foods plant based diet. I've been vegan for almost 7 years, but I've had periods where I had a vegetarian diet. Sometimes I even eat meat for a short period during the winter. But I always feel best when I go full plant based. 

Calorie target: 1995

Macro division:

Carbs: 161g, 33%

Protein: 97g, 20%

Fat: 101g, 47%

### Weight Loss Sprint

I started doing my weight loss in sprints.

Sprint goal: 75kg

Sprint started: Week 15, 23 April

Sprint end: Week 23

Main goal is to get a lean runner's physique with not too much muscle and no fat.

This will likely be around 70-72kg.

### Fasting

I've been doing some form of Intermittent Fasting for over 7 years now. 

After a period of eating One Meal A Day (OMAD) for a few months, I'm back on an 8 hour eating window, starting at noon and ending at 8pm.

# Daily Habits

## Morning Light Viewing

Popularized by Andrew Huberman. Get at least 10 minutes of sunlight directly into the eyes within 2 hours of waking up. 

## Exercise

Goal is to get at least 30 minutes of exercise everyday, but I'm averaging much more. I averaged 66 minutes over the past 6 months, and 90 minutes over the past two months (as per 2023-05-26)

Currently I go for a fasted run right after I wake up in the morning. I aim to do this 6 times a week. After my run I do 10 minutes of pushups and other bodyweight exercises.

In the afternoon I do a session of Ashtanga Yoga mostly focussing on stretching my back and hamstrings.

After dinner I go for a 20 minute walk.

## Meditation

I practice formal sitting meditation 30-60 minutes a day. Sometimes I'll go for several hours a day.

Throughout my daily activities I strive to maintain continuous mindfulness.

Running has become a meditation as well, and I do that for about 45 minutes a day too.

## Cleaning

I keep my environment clean and clutter free because it aids in mental calm, focus and well being. I want my apartment to always be presentable to visitors at any time of the day.

# Work

I've fallen in love with Kubernetes after I obtained my CKA.

I'm currently getting a lot of Cloud Engineer experience in an Azure environment. I focus on Azure Kubernetes Service, but I also contribute with deploying and maintaining other resources such as Virtual machines, firewalls and Application Gateways.

After getting my AZ104 and AZ400 during February, I don't have any certifications on the horizon currently because I discovered the joy of running and I'm focusing more on health and exercise in my free time. But this will change soon, everything goes in phases with me. When I feel more established in my training routines there will be mental space for learning again. 

# Health

## Sleep

I aim to sleep 7 hours a day. My 6 month average as per 2023-05-26 is 8 hours and 4 minutes.


## Exercise

See above :) 

## Sobriety

I don't drink alcohol or use any other mind-altering drugs. On 2023-07-04 I'll be celebrating 5 years of sobriety.

# Spirituality

I'm a practicing Buddhist. I found my religion in Therevadan Buddhism, and I found that the Thai Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah suits me best. I've been on the 5 precepts for nearly 5 years now.
