## Weight Loss

I've been on a weight loss regime sinds late 2021. I've maintained a caloric deficit since I started, but in some periods life got in the way and I had breaks from the caloric deficit. 

See:

[🍎 My Weight Loss Journey And Current Goal 📉](/zet/weight-loss-journey/)

### Diet

I eat a whole foods plant based diet. I've been vegan for almost 7 years, but I've had periods where I had a vegetarian diet. Sometimes I even ate meat for a short period during the winter. But I always feel best when I go full plant based. 

I've narrowed my diet down to fruits and vegetables, beans, brown rice, nuts and seeds.

Macro division:

Carbs: 33%

Protein: 20%

Fat: 47%

### Fasting

I've been doing some form of Intermittent Fasting for over 7 years now. 

After a period of eating One Meal A Day (OMAD) for a few months, I'm back on an 8 hour eating window, starting at noon and ending at 8pm.

# Daily Habits

## Morning Light Viewing

Popularized by Andrew Huberman. Get at least 10 minutes of sunlight directly into the eyes within 2 hours of waking up. 

## Exercise

Goal is to get at least 30 minutes of exercise everyday, but I'm averaging much more. I averaged 66 minutes over the past 6 months, and 90 minutes over the past two months (as per 2023-05-26)

Currently I go for a fasted run right after I wake up in the morning. I aim to do this 6 times a week. After my run I do 10 minutes of pushups and other bodyweight exercises.

In the afternoon I do a session of Ashtanga Yoga mostly focussing on stretching my back and hamstrings.

After dinner I go for a 20 minute walk.

## Meditation

I practice formal sitting meditation 30-60 minutes a day. Sometimes I'll go for several hours a day.

Throughout my daily activities I strive to maintain continuous mindfulness.

Running has become a meditation as well, and I do that for about 45 minutes a day too.

## Cleaning

I keep my environment clean and clutter free because it aids in mental calm, focus and well being. I want my apartment to always be presentable to visitors at any time of the day.

# Work

I've fallen in love with Kubernetes after I obtained my CKA.

I'm currently getting a lot of Cloud Engineer experience in an Azure environment. I focus on Azure Kubernetes Service, but I also contribute with deploying and maintaining other resources such as Virtual machines, firewalls and Application Gateways.

After getting my AZ104 and AZ400 during February, I don't have any certifications on the horizon currently because I discovered the joy of running and I'm focusing more on health and exercise in my free time. But this will change soon, everything goes in phases with me. When I feel more established in my training routines there will be mental space for learning again. 

# Health

## Sleep

I aim to sleep 7 hours a day. My 6 month average as per 2023-05-26 is 8 hours and 4 minutes.


## Exercise

See above :) 

## Sobriety

I don't drink alcohol or use any other mind-altering drugs. On 2023-07-04 I'll be celebrating 5 years of sobriety.

# Spirituality

I'm a practicing Buddhist. I found my religion in Therevadan Buddhism, and I found that the Thai Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah suits me best. I've been on the 5 precepts for nearly 5 years now. 

# Quotes that Inspire me

>"“I’m only a scribe,” I mumbled. “All I know is clay tablets.” “Nonsense!” he interjected. “You’re skilled in language and communication, which puts you far ahead of most. And remember this—the best investment you can make is in yourself. Continue to educate yourself and seek out wisdom, adding new skills and experiences that will make you more valuable." - location: 169 ^ref-57645 - The Richest Man in Babylon
