Welcome to my page! I'm Mischa and I'm a DevOps Engineer from Amsterdam.

On this blog I share what I learn by writing articles and publishing notes about the topics I'm studying.

I started with long form articles but it is turning more into a public Zettelkasten.

If you'd like to know more about me and my blog, go to the [About Me](/aboutme) page. 

If you'd like to search this blog or see the files, head over to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mischavandenburg/blog) where it is stored. And give me a star while you're at it! 🌟 😁
