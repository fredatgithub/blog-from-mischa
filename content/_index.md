# The Cloud Native Craftsman

Welcome to my website. I’m Mischa, a Cloud Native Engineer from Amsterdam.

Here I share thoughts and learnings about technical topics such as Microsoft
Azure, Kubernetes, Cloud Native technologies, DevOps and Linux. I'm also very
interested in anything that increases my productivity, so you will also find
writings on Zettelkasten, (Neo)vim, study techniques and anything that has to do
with taking notes.

In 2024 I was awared the Microsoft MVP title for my efforts of sharing knowledge
with the community.

Years of sharing knowledge on YouTube and this blog have uncovered a talent for
tackling difficult technical topics and explaining them in simple terms to
others.

In other words, I've found out that I have a knack for teaching. Following this
curiousity I started a [Skool Community](https://mischavandenburg.com/skool)
where I create video courses on Kubernetes, Productivity, DevOps and much more.
My courses are also available on
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/mischa-van-den-burg/)

My courses have been received very well and I receive plenty of positive
feedback.

This blog is also available for your preferred RSS reader. Use
