# Living on the Command Line

Welcome to my website. Iâ€™m Mischa, a Cloud Native Engineer from Amsterdam.

Here I share thoughts and learnings about technical topics such as Microsoft Azure, Kubernetes, Cloud Native technologies, DevOps and Linux.

In 2024 I was awared the Microsoft MVP title for my efforts of sharing knowledge with the community.
