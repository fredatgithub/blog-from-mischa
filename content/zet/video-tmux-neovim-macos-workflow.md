I've just released a comprehensive video delving deep into my Neovim setup and command-line centric workflow. This video is a response to the curiosity of my YouTube subscribers. It's an all-inclusive guide from A to Z, detailing the rationale behind my configuration choices. I've spent years perfecting my workflow and this video has been several months in the making, so I'm excited that I can finally share it with you.

My workflow is completely based on the command line.
I therefore have very little programs or tools running on the graphical side of the OS, whether it be MacOS or Linux. All I need is the terminal and a web browser, but a window manager is a big bonus to my productivity.

My main philosophy is to have a minimalistic workflow which uses very little resources. It should be a distraction-free, 
keyboard centered and efficient environment to do my best work.
