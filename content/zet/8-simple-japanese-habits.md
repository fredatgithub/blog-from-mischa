Through YouTube I've been exposed to quite a bit of Japanese culture and I love many aspects of it. I love this list of habits, and I was surprised to see how many of them I already incorporate.

1. Clean the Toilet

Many successful businessmen clean the toilet every day. It humbles you. Ajahn Chah also talks about this a lot. Check out "Toilets on the Path". I'm also very focused on cleanliness and especially emphasize keeping my toilet clean. But I like the idea of cleaning it every day and I'm going to give it a try.

2. Put your shoes away neatly

Just look at how clean that looks in the video! Fortunately I also have a habit of putting them neatly on a rack I have.

3. Improve your posture

Investing in my Herman Miller chair has been a huge improvement to my life, and combined with yoga my posture has improved a lot over the past few months. I walk more upright and find myself correcting posture more often than before.

4. Thanking for meals

Being grateful for all people who were involved in making that meal. The farmers, the cooks, everybody. 

Being grateful for life.

I can definitely improve on this and appreciate my food more.

5. Put the chair back after you use it

Japanese people are very concerned with other people's feelings. Putting a chair back in a restaurant you will make the restaurant staff happy, for example. I'm usually quite considerate about these things and generally want to make the world a better place. I have a habit of thinking, "how can I make this person's day a little better?"

6. Appreciate the things you already have

Don't look at the things you don't have, but look at what you already have. 

7. Okage Samade

A phrase that means something to the effect of "I am good because of all the people that suppport me". Used when someone asks "How are you?"

8. Going to bed early and waking up early. 

This is absolutely true. I get up at 6 every day. At 10pm I usually start winding down for bed and lights are off at 23:00. I've also gone through long periods of getting up at 4 or 3am, and I felt great doing so. I'm currenlty using 6am because I sometimes have social engagements that prevent me from going to bed very early.
