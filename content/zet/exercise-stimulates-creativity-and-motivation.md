I noticed multiple times now that during my workouts my mind is generating lots of new ideas for coding projects or blog posts. It is a well known fact that walking stimulates areas in the brain that which will in turn stimulate creativity. But I'm noticing that it starts to happen with strength workouts as well. 

Although I don't struggle with the motivation to get myself to the gym, I sometimes feel "guilty" for not spending that time on coding or studying. I'm realizing now that this is a very irrational train of thought.

Exercise actually stimulates my creativity and will help generating new ideas or help me understand concepts better in the unconscious. It is also massively beneficial for health and general well being. When general well-being is enhanced I'll also be able to focus better and absorb information more quickly.

I should re-frame my thinking and actually put exercise as priority number 1. Exercise time is never wasted time. It indirectly contributes to my productivity and coding endeavours as well.
