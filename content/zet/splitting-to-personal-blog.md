I've been struggling with this ever since I started blogging 2 years ago (can't believe it's already been that long). But I've finally made the decision: I'm keeping this blog at mischavandenburg.com as a tech and career focused blog where I share technical knowledge and notes, and I'm starting a new personal blog at [mischavandenburg.blog](https://mischavandenburg.blog).

I have fallen in love with blogging. Documenting my own life in writing has become a very therapeutic and valuable experience to me. Even if nobody reads what I put out into the world, it is incredibly satisfying to scroll through your own blog and go back in time to see what I was learning or doing or feeling at that time.

Blogging is an expression of creativity to me. My fingers move on the keyboard and an article appears. I'm creating text. I'm not a visual person, unfortunately. I don't see images when I think and I'm rather bad at drawing or arranging things in a pleasing way. Throughout my life I have expressed my creativity in music, but I consciously haven't engaged in making music in the past few years because it takes up so much time in practice. But I have found a very rewarding way of expressing myself in writing by blogging.

However, I feel that I am constraining myself on this blog because it is is linked to my LinkedIn account and I keep posting to LinkedIn from here. Even though I have nothing to hide, I'm pouring my thoughts out on the internet after all, I do feel that LinkedIn is best kept as a professional platform where people can expect consistency and a focus on technical topics, even when they navigate away from there to my own blog.

But I have so much more to give. I want to write about topics that deeply interest me: meditation, Buddhism, running, plant-based diet, healthy living, longevity, mental health, addiction. I feel the urge to pour out these thoughts freely in a place I can call my home on the web, without feeling any restraint or concern. That's why I gave my new blog the headline **"A place where I can truly be free".**

Another reason why I'm splitting it off is because I intend to use this blog in the process of becoming a Microsoft MVP. The achievement of that goal was not in my mind when I started blogging about personal topics on this blog, but now I think it will be best to keep this blog clean and technical in order to present a clear image in the MVP approval process.

I don't care about SEO or ads or the amount of views this blog gets. It's not about SEO optimization or having to have a niche. I'm more concerned with giving any readers a good experience as possible.

So here we go. This blog has a (re)new(ed) technical focus, and I'm going to keep sharing my notes, learnings, AKS and Azure updates and other discoveries I make along the way. But I'll also be migrating away the personal posts on running, weeknotes and other posts away from this blog.
