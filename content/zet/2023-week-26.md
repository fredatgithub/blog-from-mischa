It's been a pretty good week, less busy than last week. I went to Azure Lowlands and I've been creating a lot of YouTube videos.

## Exercise & Weight Loss

I went out for runs 5 times a week. 

My long run was 50 minutes and 8,24km, which is 5m more than last week. Improvement!

The morning runs were all 5k every time, except for monday which was 4,16km. 

Although I'm back on track with the running I start noticing a dip in the motivation now that I have a good baseline established. I need to find some new inspiration and motivation.

I think I should start logging weekly distance again. During May my weekly distance hovered around 33km, but then I started working on increasing my cadence to 170+ spm, so the distances became shorter as expected. Additionally, pulling an all-nighter for Graspop really deregulated my schedule and training, but now I'm back on track.

Last week total was 20km, this week total was 27km. 

To get more motivation I'll start tracking weekly totals again and try to keep increasing them again. Maybe try to have acouple of 6K morning runs this week.

My weight was down 1kg from last week.

## Content Consumption

### Reading

Finished reading "Finding Ultra". Very inspiring book.

Also finished The Simple Path to Wealth by JJ Collins. It was an inspiring read, assuring me of my investing strategy of putting everything in index funds.

### Watching

I haven't watched much YouTube this week. I've been focused on creating them!

An inspring video from the Caloric Restriction society from 2004. Motivating to see these trim healthy people discuss their caloric restriction habits:

A very good Azure Bicep course, Bicep for Real:

No podcasts were listened to.

But I'm really enjoying the album [Heljareyga](https://www.metalmusicarchives.com/artist/heljareyga) by Heri Joensen from Tyr
