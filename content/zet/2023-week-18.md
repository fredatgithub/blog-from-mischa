# Week 18

## My Week

It has been a pretty good week. Rather busy at work with some unforeseen trouble for our production patching windows, which required rescheduling everything. Managed to clean up 2800 lines of code ðŸ§¹

Went to see Sabaton and had a great time. 

Otherwise I've been preparing for the Diablo 2 Ladder Reset and played from Friday afternoon.

## Exercise & Weight Loss

My weight loss plateaued this week. I had two days where I overate, and I didn't do any 5:2 fasting this week. I'm adjusting my daily calories downward to 1600 calories a day, eating only one meal a day. 

Before I sometimes had a smaller meal at 16:00 to tide me over to dinner and to increase the protein consumption. But now I'm sticking to strict OMAD (One Meal A Day).

I did keep up my exercise routine. The base building is going well, I set a new record by running 67 minutes today, and I didn't have any knee pain. I went for two strength workouts as well.

## Gaming

Having a lot of fun with the Diablo 2 reset. I haven't gamed for months, but it is fun to be back at it for a little bit. Everybody is poor and people are collaborating to finish the game. 

I have a lvl 83 druid now with some very basic gear and it's fun to learn how to use the character optimally and finding my playstyle.

It is tempting to make another character because everybody is so collaborative, but perhaps it is best to just stick to one character.

# Next Week

I'll have an office day on Tuesday and I have many cluster upgrades planned at work.

I'll be meeting a friend from Norway for dinner on Saturday evening, looking forward to that.

Planning on strict OMAD all week and keeping up the running base training. Otherwise I'm allowed to play Diablo 2 whenever I feel like it.

## Goals & Intentions

- [ ] Strict OMAD
* [ ] Stricter food logging
- [ ] 5+ runs
