Some interesting facts about Azure from this Reddit post by Denis Kazakov, Microsoft MVP

Things that stand out to me:

* 85% of Fortune 500 companies use Microsoft Azure Cloud
* Azure generated a revenue of 75,3 billion in 2022 which is 38% of whole Microsoft's revenue. It is x3 in compare to 2017.
* The project name was Red Dog internally, which you can sometimes see as DNS or as cloud service VM hostnames like RDxxxxx
