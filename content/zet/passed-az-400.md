I'm typing this 30 minutes after I passed my AZ-400 exam. I'm sitting in a lovely cafe on Leidseplein in Amsterdam and feel relieved. Another significant certification bites the dust. This one took about 70 hours of study.

I started preparing immediately after passing my AZ-104 exam, which was a good move. The AZ-400 requires you to know many details about Azure services and how to access them. For example, Shared Access Signatures are only used for accessing storage accounts, but they came up quite often as alternative answers to the questions.

The exam itself was difficult, but the AZ-104 was harder. The AZ-104 exam was more challenging because the questions were complicated and required you to simultaneously balance many different factors in the mind. The AZ-400 was difficult because the answer alternatives that are provided are incredibly similar to each other, and they make you very insecure about what the right choice might be. As a result, I changed my answers many times.

I will do another study guide for this certification soon and publish my notes and Anki deck too. Now it's time to celebrate and relax a little.
