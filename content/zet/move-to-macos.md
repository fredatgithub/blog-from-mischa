My new employer kindly sponsored me with a new 16-inch MacBook Pro M2. I chose 32GB Ram and the base model with 12 CPU and 19 GPU cores and 1TB of hard disk. These specifications will suit my needs well. 

I've been daily driving Linux for a year now, and it has been such an incredible journey. Building my own Arch Linux system taught me much about Linux and what it means to maintain a system yourself. I will undoubtedly miss my custom AwesomeWM configuration and the freedom that Arch provides.

Technically I could have chosen a Windows laptop and installed Linux on it. But I went for a Mac for the following reasons:

- Compatibility. I'll be doing contracts for various customers, so I'll likely run into environments where I'll need to use some software, such as a VPN that is not supported on Linux. MacOS will always be compatible everywhere.
- Portability. I'll probably be going to the office multiple times a week, and using a MacBook as a daily driver will allow me to take my full setup with me everywhere. I also plan to spend some time abroad, and using a MacBook as a daily driver will allow me to work remotely for extended periods.
- Stability. Even though my Linux systems never really broke on me, there is always a possibility. I don't have to worry about that with MacOS.

Even though I'll be switching to my MacBook as my primary workstation, I will continue using Linux for my hobby projects and home lab. So there will be plenty of opportunity to keep growing in that area in the future.
