## The Fastest Runners in the World

Running is one of the most popular and accessible sports in the world. Millions of people run for fun, fitness, or competition. But who are the fastest runners in the world? How fast can they run different distances, such as 10km, 5km, or marathon? And how do their speeds compare to the average runner?

In this blog post, I will look at the current world records for these three distances. I will also convert them to minutes per km speed, which is a common way to measure running pace. 

### 10km

The current world records for the 10km are:

- Men: 26:24 minutes, set by Rhonex Kipruto of Kenya in 2020. This means he ran at an average pace of 2.64 minutes per km, or 15.3 km/h.
- Women: 29:43 minutes, set by Joyciline Jepkosgei of Kenya in 2017. This means she ran at an average pace of 2.98 minutes per km, or 13.6 km/h.

These records are incredible when you consider that the average 10km time for men of all ages is 56:35 minutes, and for women of all ages is 1:04:49 minutes, according to a study by RunRepeat. That means the record holders are more than twice as fast as the average runner!

### 5km

The current world records for the 5km are:

- Men: 12:49 minutes, set by Berihu Aregawi of Ethiopia in 2021. This means he ran at an average pace of 2.56 minutes per km, or 15.8 km/h.
- Women: 14:19 minutes, set by Ejgayehu Taye of Ethiopia in 2021. This means she ran at an average pace of 2.86 minutes per km, or 14.2 km/h.

These records are also impressive when you compare them to the average 5km time for men of all ages, which is 28:46 minutes, and for women of all ages, which is 34:32 minutes, according to another study by RunRepeat. That means the record holders are almost twice as fast as the average runner!

### Marathon

The marathon is the ultimate road race distance that requires stamina, strength, and mental toughness. The current world records for the marathon are:

- Men: 2:01:09 hours, set by Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya in 2022. This means he ran at an average pace of 2.87 minutes per km, or 14 km/h.
- Women: 2:14:04 hours, set by Brigid Kosgei of Kenya in 2019. This means she ran at an average pace of 3.18 minutes per km, or 12.7 km/h.

These records are astounding when you think that the average marathon time for men of all ages is 4:32:49 hours, and for women of all ages is 5:09:45 hours, according to yet another study by RunRepeat. That means the record holders are more than twice as fast as the average runner!

### Conclusion

As you can see, the fastest runners in the world are truly remarkable athletes who can run at speeds that most of us can only dream of. They have trained hard and dedicated themselves to their sport, and have achieved amazing feats of human performance.
