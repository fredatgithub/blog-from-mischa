There is a well documented relationship between stress response and obesity. Many obese people have a higher stress response, and they have become accustomed to dealing with this stress response through eating. 

Manifests as huge cravings for food which can be nearly impossible to manage, leading to binge eating. 

There are two types of people: people who stop eating when stressed and people who start to crave when stressed.

(I am definitely in the second cateogry without a doubt.)

These people have problems with satiety, cannot feel satiated and have eating disorders. They benefit from mindful eating practices and getting in touch with the physiological response to food.
