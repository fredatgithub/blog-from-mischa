I notice that I'm not writing in my journal every day like I used to. I always wrote down what I did, what I felt, what my plans and ambitions were, every single day.

During my holiday I started writing by hand in a notebook again which was really nice. It felt good to feel the pencil scratching on the paper again and to practice my cursive writing.

After I came back I first tried to keep journaling by hand again, but after a few days the journal remained untouched. I figured I would go back to my usual digital journaling again by writing daily notes.

I'm a litlte intruiged. I do feel very relaxed and at ease, perhaps I do not need to write so much at this time? Writing down frustrations and feelings definitely has been a certain way of processing them.

And perhaps my routine is reaching such a degree of stability that it is simply not worth the effort of writing it all down all the time.

Rather than writing in my personal notes, I do have the intention to write more zets in my public zettelkasten on all the topics that interest me currently. Micronotes.
