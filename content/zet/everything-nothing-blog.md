Read an interesting post this morning about [E/N websites.](http://sawv.org/en.html) Apparently a phenomenon from the early days of the web, E/N websites meant everything to the publisher, but maybe nothing to the rest of the world. The term may have been the predecessor of the term "weblog" which was shortened to blog. 

>E/N description: The website's author covers a myriad of topics. It's not narrowly focused. The author writes about everything or at least everything that's important to the author. The site might contain something useful for anyone who visits. The content means everything to the publisher, but it could mean nothing to the rest of the world. 

In [this post from March](/zet/articles/write-about-health-personal/) I declared that I would write more about my personal life and expanding the range of topics that I would publish on my blog / zettelkasten. And it has a great decision so far. 

I thoroughly enjoy the sense of freedom it has given me. Rather than constraining myself to one subject area, I feel free to write about anything that currently interests me. Writing about these topics stimulates further research and more intentional content consumption. 

I'm sharing more and more personal content, and this is the type of content one might expect to be seen on a social media platform. I don't use social media much, and decided to carve out my own space on the internet and write there instead. I will always be the owner of this content, and I can write about whatever I want and change the appearance and presentation.

I can't explain why, but there is something very satisfying about scrolling through my [archives](/archives/) and seeing the things that caught my interest during those particular months, knowing that it is publically available and that others might be piqued by the keywords as well. 

Discovering [Roy Tang's website](https://roytang.net/) was also very inspirational. I picked up the idea of sharing my week notes and logging the content consumption from his blog. Reading Hacker News regularly has exposed me to several personal blogs which I've added to my RSS feeds, and I enjoy reading about their interests and getting inspiration from what they decide to publish on their blogs.
