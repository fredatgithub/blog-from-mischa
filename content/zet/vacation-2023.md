I've just finished my last workday and tomorrow I'm heading off to Norway! When I glance at the amount of posts I've made on my blog recently it's obvious that it is time for a break from the entire routine. I've been tapering down to this moment for a while now, toning down the studying and prioritizing relaxation so I can enter the holidays with a clear mind.

Now it's time for lots of fresh air, mountains, many kilometres on the trails, and to pick up the connection to Nature I've made during the 9 years that I lived in the beautiful North.
