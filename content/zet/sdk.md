A software development kit (SDK) is a set of tools provided by the manufacturer of (usually) a hardware platform, operating system (OS), or programming language. 

SDKs contain all the tools you need to get started. They typically contain a compiler, a debugger and an API. But they can also contain documentation and testing tools.
