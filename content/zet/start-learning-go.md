For month's I considered to learn Go, and today I finally started.

I doubted for a long time, because I figured it would be better to dive deeper into Python. However, when I reflected on it, I realized I'm able to do the things I want to do in Python. I can create scripts to manipulate data, and I can string different tools and libraries together if I need to. So how deep do I actually need to go as a DevOps Engineer?

The breakthrough came when I discovered this website: [Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/language/go). It's a collection of issues in open source projects which are suitable for people who are starting out. Scrolling through the available projects for Python and Go, I noticed I got a lot more energy from the things I saw in the Go list: Grafana, ArgoCD, Kubernetes. I probably have a long way to go before I can make any meaningful contributions, but my goal is to be able to contribute to open source in the future.

Additionally, I'm going to focus my career in the direction of Kubernetes and CNCF, where Go is mostly used. 

I have a week off before I start my new job so I'm going to spend a few hours a day to get a good start, and when I'm working full time again, my plan is to spend at least one pomodoro (25 minutes) a day on Go. Small increments will add up to something big over time.

I created [a new GitHub repo](https://github.com/mischavandenburg/go) where I'll be uploading all my practice code and projects.
