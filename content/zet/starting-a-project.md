I'm starting a project with a friend. Developing an application. We make a good team, he's great at coding and knows the backend too. 

He'll do the development, I'm in charge of hosting. We're setting everything up in Azure DevOps, so it is a great way to practice my Azure skills and apply the things I've learned in my recently obtained [AZ-104](/zet/articles/az-104-study-guide/) Azure Administrator certification.

Even though it is a small scale hobby project, I still plan to approach it as if it was an enterprise production application. I'll set up a full CI/CD pipeline with testing in a secure manner. Credentials stored in an Azure key vault and images pushed to a private registry. 

This is going to be fun!
