Although I rarely use Obsidian anymore, I still have it open because it is running the obsidian-git plugin in the background and it is constantly backing up my second brain to GitHub.

I use iCloud to synch my vault across my iOs devices and I always create and edit my files using neovim.

For my new gig at work I'm forced to use a windows laptop which means I cannot use iCloud to synch my vault. Then it is a godsend to be able to install Obsidian and use that to interact with my second brain.

It is very good to keep it compatible with obsidian so I can use the software for synching and interacting with my second brain on other operating systems conveniently.
