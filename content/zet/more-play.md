This Sunday I still felt very tired from the first week at the new workplace. It's always a lot of stimualtion and impulses to process for me and I forced myself to do absolutely nothing this weekend. So today I played Magic The Gathering Arena all day and now that I'm writing these weeknotes on sunday evening I feel very calm, relaxed and recharged, ready for the new work week.

This is also something that came up during my hikes in Norway. I have a need to introduce more play and less rigidity into my life. I love routines, protocols and predictability. Play is about improvisation, creativity and not knowing what will happen.

I need more of that in my life, and I feel now that it is having a positive effect. I'm not saying I should game for 8 hours a day, I just need to loosen up a little bit on the productivity. Especially play that involves other people. 

I purchased a Magic The Gathering starter kit and hung out with my brother on Saturday and we had a great time socializing over this game. It is a bonding activity through play.
