Before I went on holiday I formed the intention to begin studying again after I came back.

During my current gig I'm configuring a fair bit of networking, VNets, peerings, firewall rules and set up a full hub-spoke network from scratch, so I've had a fair bit of practical experience. Now that the experience is still fresh in the mind I figured I'd go for this certification.

Usually I only use Microsoft Learn and practice exams, but this time around I want to try out a video course. I purchased a year of A Cloud Guru access and so far it has been a good experience.

I'll publish my notes as I go along.
