* added a new node to k3s cluster thinkpad 8gb
* configured a tls certificate for weave

Struggled because cloudflare for some reason didn't resolve the DNS record when I first configured it.
It was fixed when I added another dummy record just to test it with nslookup.

* split off grafana from the kube-prometheus-stack helm chart
