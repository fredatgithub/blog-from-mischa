# What I Learned from Kipchoge, the Fastest Marathon Runner in the World

Kipchoge is not only a world-class athlete, but also a source of inspiration and wisdom for anyone who wants to improve their life. I recently listened to an interview with him on YouTube, and I was amazed by his insights on running, success, pain, discipline and happiness. Here are some of the key takeaways and a summary of what he shared.

## Preparation and Planning is the Key

Kipchoge believes that success does not come by chance, but by pure and clean planning in preparation. He follows a strict program and sticks to it to the letter. He writes down everything in his journal every day, and documents his progress and challenges. He also avoids distractions and focuses on his priorities. 

I really appreciate his emphasis on planning everything out meticulously. You should approach your training with a clear goal and intention and make a plan to reach that goal. I also identify with his habit of writing everything down, of course. This is what I've been practicing myself for several years now, and it is nice to see yet another highly successful person who also shares this habit.

## Morning Routine

Kipchoge has a morning routine which is very similar to my own. He wakes up at 5:45 and is out running by 6:10. When he comes back he has a shower and has breakfast. Only when that is finished will he look at his phone and check his messages and emails. 

I also run first thing in the morning. I really enjoy to have it done for the day, and I prefer to exercise on an empty stomach. I think I will try Kipchoge's routine of not looking at the phone until the morning rituals are finished. I tend to check the news and read messages before I go out on my run, and then I use the run to prepare for the day. I'll try to get out with a "clean mind" and see what happens this week. 

## Movement Leads to a Long and Happy Life

Kipchoge sees running as the best movement and the key to life. He says that life is about movement, and if you move, that's how you have a good life. He runs every day, even when he does not feel like it, because he knows that running is not only good for his body, but also for his mind. He runs in a group of people, and enjoys the social aspect of running. He says that running in a group helps him to talk, exchange ideas and learn from others. He also encourages running as a family lifestyle, and says that running should be fun and enjoyable.

## Pain is Part of Success

Kipchoge smiles when he runs, even when he is feeling pain. He says that when he smiles while running, he is actually enjoying the pain. He explains that pain is where success is, and those who know how to handle pain will be successful and move up to another level. Kipchoge also says that training is not the same as competing, and that training happens at a slower pace where you can follow the pace of the group. But when he competes, he pushes himself to the limit and embraces the pain.

## Vitamin N

Kipchoge shares a simple but powerful advice: inject yourself with vitamin N. What is vitamin N? It stands for NO! Kipchoge says that you need to learn to say no to things that are not aligned with your goals and values. You also need to set your priorities right and avoid complaining. These three things will help you develop self-discipline and achieve your dreams.

## Listening to Podcasts

When I started running I listened to music, but after I could run for more than 20 minutes, I started to see my runs as a form of active meditation. I deliberately avoid listening to music and podcasts so I can focus completely on the running experience and use the breath, body and movement as meditation objects. However, Kipchoge says that it is all right to listen to music or podcasts during easy runs. They will make the time pass by very quickly.

I hope you enjoyed this blog post and learned something from Kipchoge's wisdom. If you want to listen to the full interview, you can find it here:
