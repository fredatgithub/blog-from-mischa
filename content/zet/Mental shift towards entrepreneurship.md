Noticing that things are changing in my mind. Working long hours feels very
different from being an employee. Every hour I spend on work feels as if it is
spent on building something of my own. And it's true. It's not just a feeling,
it's reality.

My Skool community and the course portfolio is my product, my SAAS. And it feels
so much more rewarding to put in the work towards something that you own. You
can see it grow.

And it grows in direct relation with the effort you put in. I've been putting in
so much work besides my day job, but I can hardly wait to have all of the time
and mental capacity to devote towards my business.

Now that I'm an entrepreneur I'm operating on a different level: the
entrepreneurial level, and I will start interacting with a different set of
people. I notice people around me while I go shopping, and I notice I have a new
box to place them in: entrepreneur and non-entrepreneur. I imagine I can
determine from people's appearance whether they are an entrepreneur or not. It's
fun to see if I can spot them. Next step is to get the balls to approach them.
