# Week 20

## My Week

It was a nice week. I had an extra day off on Asenscion day and I decided to go for a camping trip for the first time after I moved back to the Netherlands.

It was a great experience, and I wrote a couple of Tumblr posts with photos:

## Exercise & Weight Loss

Went on a 12km hike on my camping trip.

But I also managed to get my 5 runs in. One of them on Sunday morning, in the woods on my camping trip. It is going well and I am progressing nicely with my base building. Weekly distance increased with 0.5km. 

# Week 20 - 5

- Easy Run 1 Tue 44min
- Easy Run 2 Wed 55min
- Easy Run 3 Thu 47min
- Easy Run 4 Sun 42min
- Long Run   Fri 86min

* Total distance: 32,8km

Weight loss is also progressing well. I missed a couple of weigh-ins because of the camping trip so I don't have a reliable weekly average. But on Monday I weighed 75.5kg, due to a lot of lost water weight from the trip. This is the first time I see the 75 on the scale, after being on a 76kg plateau for more than 6 months, so it was a big moment. But since it was water weight, I bumped back to 76.6kg the next day, which is still a good progression from last week.

## Content Consumption

### Reading

Interesting article on making the web human again, because so much is being generated by AI, including emails. Why bother writing?

### Watching

An awesome video on spending money on experiences:

[I wrote a zet about this video](/zet/invest-in-experiences-for-happiness/)

I discovered Aki's channel called Samurai Matcha and I've watching a lot of his content.

Being a minimalist myself, I find it his content hugely inspiring.
