Read an interesting Reddit thread today where commenters explained the complexities of running Kubernetes. Indeed it is easy to set up, but that is only the beginning.

The real art is to build distributed systems on top of it, and it is dauntingly complex. That's why I'm so attracted to it.

It does make clear just how great Azure's AKS offering actually is. So much of the administrative overhead is automated, and so far I'm under the impression it is done really well. Which is why I'm on a mission to become an AKS expert.
