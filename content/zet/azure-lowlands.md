Have you ever attended an IT event that felt like a festival from the sixties? That was my experience at Azure Lowlands! I couldn't have wished for a better first IT event. It was like going back in time, but with a modern twist.

The name Lowlands immediately appealed to me. I had no idea what to expect. And the name lived up to it! I'm a big fan of Jimi Hendrix and the Woodstock vibe, and that's exactly what I felt at Azure Lowlands. When I walked into the first talk, I was surprised by a hall full of colorful beach chairs, and people who were listening to the speaker while taking it easy and lounging in the chairs. I felt right at home!

It was like a festival, but one where you could also learn a lot. I attended fascinating presentations, on topics such as Azure Networking, Identity Management, data management on AKS, Managed Prometheus & Grafana and Azure Infrastructure as Code with Bicep. My notebook was full of notes and new insights at the end of the day that I want to delve deeper into in my evening studies. I got a lot of new ideas.

In addition, it was also cool to see my colleagues shine. There was a lot of interest in our booth and everyone was helped friendly and professionally. Hats off to the booth crew, you did a great job.

For an introvert like me, these kinds of events are quite exhausting, and I also need a few days to recover. But although it took a lot of energy, I also got a lot of energy, and that balanced each other out nicely at this event. It was also a good experience to be in a venue full of nerds for the first time: I really feel like I found my "tribe". I'll definitely be back next year!
