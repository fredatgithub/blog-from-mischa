Ran into a problem when cloning my second brain repository on a new windows machine which I need to use for work. Also trying to get familiar with VSCode although I'm doing my best to get a good WSL setup going on my new windows setup.

One problem I was running into was that I could not for the life of me clone my repository at all on Windows. Eventually I realized that it kept failing on a file that had a question mark in its filename.

I renamed all the files that had invalid characters.

It also failed because apparently I had a file in the repo named "\". It didn't like that at all.

After changing the filenames it worked.

It is good to keep my second brain compatible with all operating systems so this is actually a good practice session.
