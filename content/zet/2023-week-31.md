# My Week

This week has been a lot calmer. Spending my evenings watching Norwegian nature programmes which inspire me for my upcoming holidays. Some good developments in my private life.

I'm meditating more and doing more yoga as well.

## Exercise & Weight Loss

I'm not bringing my phone on my runs and it feels nice to have that period in the morning with a clean mind and not looking at any notifications. 

I ran 14 kilometres on Sunday, another record. And I felt like I could have kept going too.
