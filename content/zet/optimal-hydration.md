# Hydration Notes from Huberman Podcast

For the first 10 hours of the day, consume 236ml for every hour awake

During exercise, follow Galpin equation: 2ml per kg of bodyweight every 15-20 minutes on average.

This does not mean you need to stop exercising and drink this amount. You can also consume it in a larger amount afterwards. It is recommended to drink during exercise though.

Use the normal recommendation to hydrate before exercise, this establishes a good baseline for heading into exercise.

## Is this amount of water on top of the baseline hydration?

If you exercise about an hour you can replace the number with the number from the Galpin equation.

In my case, 1 hour of exercise = 77 * 2 = 154ml every 20 minutes

154 * 3 = 462ml for 1 hour of exercise

## Caffeine

Offset caffeine drinks with a 2:1 water ratio.

So 1 240ml cup of coffee should be followed by 480ml of water.

## Reducing Nightly Urination

Urine secretion / filtration in the kidneys is highly dependent on the circadian rhythm. 

It is normal to wake up once or twice to urinate during the night.

To reduce nighttime waking for urination:

* Ensure sufficient hydration during the day so you are not thirsty in the evening
* Reduce fluid intake at night (provided you hydrated sufficiently during the day)
* Consume no more than 180-240ml between 10 hours after waking and bedtime

This means, waking up at 6am, only drink 1 cup of tea after 4pm.

But I drink 500ml at dinner time, so I should probably never drink after dinner from here on out, or just one cup of tea.

How quickly you secrete fluid is also partially determined by how quickly you drink that fluid. Gulping down a lot of fluid wil lead to quicker secretion.

# My Typical Day

1 hour exercise = 500ml

2 cups of coffee 500ml

10 hours = 2,4l

So I should be drinking about 3,25L in total a day!
