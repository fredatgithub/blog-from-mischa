It's been a calmer week. Work has been busy, but I'm taking my time to relax in the evenings. I notice it is time to take a break from work. My holidays are aproaching: in three weeks I'll have three weeks off. So I'm intentionally winding down the productivity.

I hardly ever watch series. I don't have a TV. But to get into the mood for my Norway trip, I'm watching some shows I used to watch when I lived in Norway. It is very relaxing to just do nothing in the evenings afer work, instead of studying or creating content.

## Exercise & Weight Loss

I set a 5k PR this week, and on Saturday I had a great long run. I drove to the coastal area and ran 13km in 82 minutes, 1km farther than last week. Amazing to think that I've built up the endurance to run almost one and a half hour straight!

## Content Consumption

### Reading

Making progress in Eat and Run, haven't read Gridlinked this week.

### Watching

Watching the Norwegian shows "Der Ingen Skulle Tru at Nokon Kunne Bu" and "Med Monsen Pa Villspor". 

Very nostalgic to see this content again and it is really getting me excited for my upcoming Norway trip.
