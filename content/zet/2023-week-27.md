I feel calmer now, because I didn't have any meetups or social events this week. I've been less busy and had more time for meditation and yoga and I can notice the effects instantly. I'm feeling more relaxed and I allow myself more time for reading. 

On the other hand I've been quite productive on the content creation side. And to create the content, I experiment on my Lab subscription in Azure, which bring me a lot of learning and experience at the same time, so it is a great win-win situation.

I released a few YouTube videos and blog posts and I notice that it brings me energy. It feels good to be able to give something back to the community. 

## Exercise & Weight Loss

Running is going well now. Increased my weekly distance with 4km for a total of 31,35km this week. Went for a 55m long run, 8,5km yesterday and felt good! I started reading 'Eat and Run' and watching some motivational videos which helped me find more pleasure in running again.

Weight has remained stable.

### Reading

#### Books

I finished Finding Ultra and A Simple Path to Wealth. Some notes can be found [here](/zet/book-notes-simple-path-to-wealth/).

Started reading "Eat and Run" by Jurek, another vegan ultrarunner. I'm abot 30% in already and it is an inspiring story so far, with a lot of practical advice added in between. 

Also, I'm branching out my fiction reading. I haven't been reading much fiction these past few years. I never read any science fiction but now I felt like exploring that world, especially around AI. 

After some Reddit searches I ended up with the Polity series by Neal Asher which received a lot of praise. 

I've only started reading it but it is well written so far and I find myself getting into it and wanting to read more. Let's see where this goes!

#### Articles

Some articles on the evolution of "three meals a day", and discovered that the Romans usually ate only one meal a day:
