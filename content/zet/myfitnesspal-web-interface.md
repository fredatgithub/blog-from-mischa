title: Apps with web interfaces win any day, switching to MyFitnessPal

Recently I was comparing apps for navigation (TopoGPS and Outdooractive). Both apps are great, but the main perk of Outdooractive is that it has a web interface. You can plan routes from your computer and access them on the iPhone app, but TopoGPS is on the iPhone only.

The app I probably have the most interaction with during the day is my calorie tracking app. I've been using YAZIO for about two years and it has been satisfactory, but there were a few small annoyances to the app and I was never completely satisfied with.

A missing web interface being one of them. I'd love to be able to sit behind my 4K screen and plan out the week's nutrition from there instead of using the clunky copy function on my phone. 

Enter MyFitnessPal. It has a web interface. It has charts and graphs. Me happy.

Why didn't I chose this app when I began using an app for my phone? I remember trying it out, but I was unhappy with it somehow. I remember something about the food database not containing the foods I was eating at the time. I've been doing some testing and up until now I haven't had to add any foods.

I have a year's subscription on YAZIO until March so it is a bit of a waste, but I'm already sold on the web interface of MFP. I have one free month of premium and I'll make the decision then.
