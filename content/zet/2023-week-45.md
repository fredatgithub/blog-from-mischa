A very rainy week where I was feeling quite tired in the evenings. Highlight of the week was [my first Magic: The Gathering pre-release event](/zet/mtg-first-prerelease-ixalan/). I spent quite some time ramping up to it by watching videos to get familiar with the set's mechanics. It took up quite some time but it was enjoyable to do and I was glad I went into the event prepared. I wrote a post with some details about my experience.

## Exercise & Weight Loss

Diet has trainwrecked and I've been eating a lot of bread and peanut butter, snacks and havent' been tracking calories. Next week it's time for a 6 day FMD again to reset.

## Learning

I did make some progress in the AZ700 course, now at 82.5% and getting into the last chapters. I think I want to do the exam on 27 november.

Also getting into the new MTG set was quite a lot of new stuff to learn.

## Playing

Did the MTG event and steady grinding on MTG arena.

## Reading

Making good progress in Sword Song.

## Watching

Mostly been watching MTG related content to get familiar with the new set and I've been enjoying Numot's streams of the early access he received to the set.

## Listening

No podcasts.
