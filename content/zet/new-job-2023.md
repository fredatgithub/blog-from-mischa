Last week I accepted a job offer! I've been hired as a DevOps Engineer by [Fullstaq](https://fullstaq.com).

Fullstaq specialises in Kubernetes and Cloud Native, so I'm really happy I could join their team. I'll be doing projects for a variety of clients, and I think it will be a great place to learn and gain more experience in the Kubernetes and CNCF space.

Fullstaq has been delightfully welcoming and great to work with so far. The future looks bright!
