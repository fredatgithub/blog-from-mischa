I've transitioned my note taking system towards a Zettelkasten system. I still use directories for folders and make copious links, but more often than not I put them in the larger generic 00-zettelkasten directory in my [Obsidian](/zet/articles/obsidian-introduction/) vault. 

The concept of "atomic notes" is also very important in Zettelkasten methods. Notes should be small and concise. 

Up until this point I've been publishing full articles on my blog. I came across [Rob Muhlestein](https://github.com/rwxrob) yesterday and I was very inspired by his setup and public zettelkasten. I think I'll move to a similar approach. Still planning to write and publish full articles as well, but also including atomic notes and personal status updates.
