My friend gave me a nice tip for customizing the readme on my personal GitHub page. I discovered there is a whole world of plugins and customizations out there. 

I set up [this one](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme) for my GitHub homepage. It uses a workflow to update the readme in my personal GitHub repo with the most recent posts from this blog, based on the RSS feed. Neat!

It was very easy to set up. If you don't have your own blog, you could configure it with a different RSS feed. Hacker News for example.
