Saturday I went to my first Magic: The Gathering event. It was the pre-release of the new set: Lost Caverns of Ixalan.

I went to Almere because a colleague is a regular participant of the events that are organized by the game store and I went with him. It was nice to have a familiar face on my first event. I arrived early and there were already a few people hovering around the game store.

When the store opened we received our pre-release packs and we walked to the event location. There you build a 40 card deck from the 6 draft boosters you received. I had planned to build a very simple deck with lots of creatures and some removal spells, but unfortunately my packs did not contain any dinosaurs or good big creatures but it contained a ton of complex artifacts and enchantments instead. When I was sorting through my cards I was feeling a bit overwhelmed.

At the beginning of the event I chatted with the organizer and told him this was my first event, and he very kindly offered me some deck building help. So I called for his help and with him we built a very cool artifact based red-white deck with lots of removal and a few sneaky flying creatures.

The event is run from the Magic Companion app. When the event starts you are assigned a table number and an opponent and then you play 3 games, and the best of 3 wins. I thought this was a very good system because it connects you to new people and you don't have to be afraid that you don't know anybody at the event because the matchup is done through the app. The app also takes your winrate into consideration so you are paired up to people of your own skill level.

The deck I built (with some help) turned out to work pretty well! My end result was 1 win, 1 loss and 3 draws. Sometimes I just had to play very defensively and cast a lot of removal but that seemed to have worked because it prevented me from losing and I even got a few wins. Even though it was not the deck I had expected or hoped to build I still had a lot of fun and I learned a lot about the old and new mechanics by playing this deck.

The day before the event I realized it was going to last from 9:30 to 17:30 and I was quite overwhelmed with that thought. Am I really going to be able to play with good concentration for 8 hours straight? I was already asking my colleague if it was possible to leave earlier.

It turned out very differently though. Like they say, time flies when you are having fun. We did not start building our decks until 10:30 and the first matches were played at around 11:30 so it was only the afternoon of actual playtime. And I noticed that when I had a few rounds with my deck under my belt I was quite cabable of thinking through the strategies every single turn until the last game. The thrill of the game was actually providing me with more energy as I played.

All in all it was a great experience. The people were all very friendly and welcoming to a new player like me. They were patient when I needed some time to think, they helped me when I didn't understand a mechanic and they even tolerated a few plays which were technically not allowed.

Participating in an event like this is part of getting out of my comfort zone. Being an introvert who loves to spend time alone, I'm forcing myself to broaden my horizons and so far it has been an enriching experience. I'm seeing more and more value in community and social interaction. A MTG event is perfect because we are all nerds, most of us introverts and outcasts in some way or another and we have a format and an activity to facilitate social interaction.

When I drove home I realized that I had expected to be very tired after the event but actually I noticed I felt quite energized because of all the learning and mental stimulation I received. This is definitely something I am going to explore more. Thank you Beeldverhaal Almere!
