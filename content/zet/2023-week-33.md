# My Week

The last full week until my holiday! All week I've been busy with preparations in the evenings.

## Exercise & Weight Loss

I'm transitioning my running into barefoot running. The Norway trip will be an upheaval of the routine anyway so it is a good moment to start. Been doing walks in minimal footwear for over a week now and on Sunday I did my first barefoot run/walk. Calves are on fire!

I also ordered a 16kg kettlebell and set up a pull up bar to incorporate some more strength work into my exercise routine. Starting fully after the holiday.

## Content Consumption

### Reading

Almost finished reading Born To Run and been dipping into The Longevity Diet a few times too

### Watching

Mostly watching barefoot runnning related content. Also watching some content related to functional strenght training. Favourite channels are Strenght Side and the Bioneer.

### Listening

SECRETS From The Lost Tribe of Barefoot Runners: Christopher McDougall & Eric Orton
