Had a great time at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam yesterday. Went to see Sabaton live. This was my second time seeing them live, and it was a great show. 

I love Sabaton because all of their material revolves around history and warfare. They are one of my favourite bands. I was super happy they played some of my favourite songs: "Carolus Rex", "Stormtroopers" and "To Hell And Back".

I've been a lover of metal music ever since childhood, but I had a break from metal music for about 5 years where I hardly listened to any music at all. But over the past 1,5 years I've been really enjoying metal music again.

I believe the last live show I saw was Cannibal Corpse in 2014 in Oslo. Nearly 10 years without a metal concert?!
