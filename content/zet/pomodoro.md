I did a lot of studying last year, and I achieved a few tough certifications. I've always been good at studying and never struggled with getting decent grades in university. As a result, I never felt the need to use particular techniques to pass my tests. However, now that I need to do my studies combined with a full-time job, I did some optimization and looked into study techniques. 

One technique I've become very fond of is the Pomodoro Technique. I don't have any problems focusing for long periods, but I still decided to try it. I use the standard 25-minute study with a 5-minute break routine, and after four cycles, I take a 30-minute break. 

The Pomodoro technique has been a way to force myself to take breaks, which I wasn't used to. I used to chip away at a specific task for hours. However, I discovered that when I take a break, walk around for five minutes, and apply myself to the task again, my mind is in a fresh state and much more receptive to the information. Perhaps the time I spend studying after a break is actually more productive because the mind had a little rest. 

The technique also pushed my limits a bit more. I study more hours a day, considering that I also work full time. There is this moment where I want to quit studying, but I ask myself, "do I have another Pomodoro in me?"

Now that I've gotten used to breaking things up into 25-minute chunks of time, I started using the Pomodoro technique for other areas in life as well, such as blog writing or coding projects.

You can use any tool you like to start using the Pomodoro technique and pick any break schedule that suits you. I'll link some resources below. All you need is some sort of timer. You can use a timer on your computer or a physical timer. I use the Forest app on my iPhone because it integrates with the iOs "do not disturb" and "focus" modes, so  I don't get any distracting notifications when I'm on a Pomodoro.
