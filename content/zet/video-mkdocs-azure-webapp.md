In this video, I will walk you through the following steps:

- Set up a repo in Azure DevOps with MkDocs files
- Set up a Static Web App in Azure portal and link it to the repo
- Configure the Azure DevOps pipeline for MkDocs deployment
- Configure a custom theme for the website
- Demonstrate the pull request workflow for updating the docs

By the end of this video, you will have a fully functional MkDocs site hosted on Azure Static Web Apps. You will also learn how to use Azure DevOps and Static Web Apps to collaborate on your documentation projects.

MkDocs is a tool that lets you create beautiful documentation websites from plain text files. You can write your docs in Markdown, a simple and easy-to-use markup language, and MkDocs will convert them into a static HTML site. You can also customize the look and feel of your site with themes and plugins.

Azure Static Web Apps is a service that hosts static web content and serverless APIs. It automatically builds and deploys your web app from a GitHub or Azure DevOps repository. It also provides features such as authentication, authorization, custom domains, and SSL certificates.
