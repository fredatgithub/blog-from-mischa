# Week 23

## My Week

It's been a busy week with a lot of social engagements. I had a nice dinner with my colleagues and I was supposed to do a Mud Run on Friday. Unfortunately I got stuck in massive traffic and I missed the start.

4 months ago I joined Fullstaq, and they have a related company called Beyond Blue, who focus on Microsoft Azure. After some conversations with my colleagues I decided to go all-in on Azure and join Beyond Blue instead. Feels goood!

I'm also doing a lot of thinking about renting versus buying and planning my financial future. 

## Exercise & Weight Loss

2 months ago I set up my 2 month challenge, and on Sunday I weighed in at 75,2kg. I made it! I had been stuck on the 76kg plateau for over 6 months, but I finally managed to break through.

My average SPM has increased to 170 during my morning runs. I did fewer runs becuase of the engagements.
