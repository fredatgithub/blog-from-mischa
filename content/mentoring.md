title: "Mentoring"
---

As a leader of a community of 150 students I am very experienced in mentoring
aspiring engineers who want to change their career.

3 years ago my official job title was Nursing Assitant. Now I am a freelance
DevOps Engineer who can choose wherever he wants to work. I hold plenty of
very difficult certifications including the CKA/CKS, and I was awarded by Microsoft
for my exceptional contributions to the community by gaining the Most Valued
Professional title.

I will happily share my secrets with you. Invest in your own career today.

I can show you the path to become a succesful Cloud / DevOps Engineer. It doesn't
matter if you are a Software Engineer with a CS degree looking into transitioning
to DevOps or whether you have no relevant background at all.

I will help you to create a personal roadmap to follow and I can coach you along
the way.
