# Are you looking to break into the industry?

I don't have a CS degree, but I managed to make it in the industry anyway. Through my YouTube channel I've received countless of comments where people tell me that they find my journey inspiring.

If you are looking to break into the industry, this is the community for you.

I have walked the path to change my career from nurse to Cloud Engineer. I know what to do and what you need to learn.

When you look over a job posting for a DevOps engineer, it's likely you'll feel overwhelmed with all of the stuff you need to learn. In these moments you need someone to point you in the right direction. Me and the community are able to analyze your current situation and recommend the next step for you.

We are a community that has a healthy mix of seniors who are eager to help and juniors who are motivated to learn.

# Connect with fellow notetakers

It's likely that you know me from my videos on productivity and notetaking. Many people who join my community are engineers, but you don't need to be an engineer to join.

One thing many of us in the community have in common is a fascination with productivity and notetaking, we regularly share our ideas with each other. Almost weekly someone will discover someone new and share it with the community.

# Not just Kubernetes

Our community is such a nice place to hang out in, that people wish to join and stay even if they are not into DevOps and Kubernetes.

# Do you wish to level up your game as an engineer?

My courses on Notetaking, productivity and soft skills can help you lift your career to the next level.

Everybody has their weak points, and we can help you to address them. You might excel everyone around you on a technological level, but if you're unable to communicate with your team members and stakeholders or if you are regarded as difficult to work with, you will stagnate and you will be stuck somewhere comfortable and stop growing.

We are here to help you with that.

Connect with likeminded engineers. Get feedback on your solutions.
