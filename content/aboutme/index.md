# Why?

Why bother with a personal website? Why not just write on social media?

[This post captures it beautifully.](https://matthiasott.com/notes/simple-truths-about-personal-websites)

# What is a Zettelkasten?

Zettelkasten is a system of note taking and personal knowledge management. [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) means "slip box" in German. Traditionally it is a physical box of slips of paper or index cards containing smaller notes. Each of these cards have a unique identifier, and these identifiers are used to create links between the cards.

It was used by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) who was one of the most prolific scholars in history. He wrote 70 books and nearly 400 academic articles, and he credited the Zettelkasten with making his productivity possible. It contained around 90,000 index cards.

I first came across this concept by reading the book [How to take Smart Notes](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes) by Sönke Ahrens. 

# How to Navigate this Website

To see an index of my entire Zettelkasten sorted in chronological order, visit [Index (Zet)](/archives/). Longer articles can be viewed at the [articles page](/tags/article/).

If you want to see an overview of topics and notes centered around certain topics, use the [Tags page](/tags/). My Zettelkasten can also be [searched](/search/).

# About This Website

What you are seeing here is the public section of my personal Zettelkasten. I keep a large collection of notes which are stored as markdown files on my harddisk. Whenever I'm studying a topic by reading or watching videos I keep notes about what I learn and store them in my Zettelkasten. 

When I want to reflect on a certain topic or to write an article, I go through my collection of notes and link them together. Very often I find that the creation of these links will stimulate even more new connections and associations, and I end up with new ideas for even more topics of study or things that I want to write about. I use my Zettelkasten as a vehicle for reflection, learning and creativity.

I decided to make part of my notes public so I can share my learning journey in the exciting field of DevOps, cloud computing and coding. And I recently started publishing my notes on other topics such as health and execrice as well.

# About me

I’m Mischa. I’ve worked across various fields ranging from project management in the oil industry to health care, but my driving passion has always been IT. Fascinated since childhood, I’ve always passionately worked on projects that leveraged computers and automation to reach my goals. 

In 2007 I started learning to code to automate the video games I used to play and to build my own websites. In 2014 I taught myself to use Linux and utilized these skills to run large-scale video game and social media automation projects to drive traffic to the websites I coded at night. 

I lived in Norway for 9 years, and when I moved back home to the Netherlands, I succeeded in following my dream and turning my passion into my career, and I’ve been working as a full-time DevOps Engineer since 2021. 

I'm [in love with my work.](/zet/articles/jiro-sushi) After I finish my day's work, I usually sit down to study more about my field. There is always something new to learn. Learning can take many forms. Very often I read or watch videos and courses and take notes. But you cannot learn everything from the books alone. You also need to learn by doing. I work on coding projects or building my Kubernetes home lab. I created a [lab repo](https://github.com/mischavandenburg/lab/) where I store all the files I use to explore these topics.

I'm curently focused on learning Go, and I store all of my learning projects in my [go repo](https://github.com/mischavandenburg/go)

# Living On The Command Line

I'm a nerd. I use neovim for all of my text editing. I have a fully customized setup with dozens of custom keybindings so I can work a little more effectively, and this blog is entirely written on the command line using vim.

I love UNIX based operating systems and I've built my custom setup in Arch Linux. I wrote [an article](/zet/articles/linux-creativity) about how customizing and maintaining my tailored operating system is a creative activity to me.

In the words of Rob Muhlenstein, *"Using the Linux Bash terminal command-line is coding. Every command you type on every line is part of an interactive, ongoing program interpreted by Bash and processed by Linux."* Having this dialogue with the computer through commands is one of the most fascinating things on this earth to me, and I feel fortunate that I can work with this every day as a DevOps engineer.

# Why Take Notes?

>“Your professional success and quality of life depend directly on your ability to manage information effectively.”
>
>Tiago Forte, Building A Second Brain

In the modern age we consume very large amounts of information, much more than we can remember. It is therefore very important to manage your intake of information, but also the retention of that information. I find that taking notes on the topics that may be of interest to me at any given time helps me understand the subject much better, because it forces me to clearly formulate my thoughts and convert them to written form.

Over time a large collection is built up which can be used to generate new ideas.

I publish certain sections of my note collection hoping it might provide value to others.

## Tags and links

To organize my notes for the website I use [tags](/tags/), but in my personal note taking system I use markdown links. This is why you will sometimes see `[[health]]` or `[[coding]]` in my notes. These are the links that I make in my personal system which I use for navigation and idea generation. It's not very pretty to have these included in the published notes, but it's the side effect of mixing a public and private Zettelkasten.
