## Living on the command line

I'm a nerd. I use neovim for most of my text editing. I have a fully customized setup with dozens of custom keybindings so I can work a little more effectively. This blog is entirely written in neovim. 

I've built my custom setup in Arch Linux. I wrote [an article](/content/articles/linux-creativity) about how customizing and maintaining my tailored operating system is a creative activity to me.

In the words of Rob Muhlenstein, *"Using the Linux Bash terminal command-line is coding. Every command you type on every line is part of an interactive, ongoing program interpreted by Bash and processed by Linux."* Having this dialogue with the computer through commands and effects is one of the most fascinating things on this earth to me, and I feel fortunate that I can work with this every day as a DevOps engineer.

## About this blog

I'm [in love with my work.](/content/articles/jiro-sushi) After I finish my day's work, I usually sit down to study more about my field. There is always something new to learn, and I always have a project and a course going.

I love to learn, and I love to write. I keep notes of the things I'm learning and I decided to make a practice of publishing them on this blog. 

Explaining things in my own words by writing articles about them is a great way to test my knowledge of a subject. Sometimes I even try to explain it as simple as possible, known as the Feynman technique. 

Sometimes I write full articles on topics, sometimes they are smaller atomic notes.
