<p>In this post, I’d like to share the five main reasons why I changed my career to IT in my thirties. Making a career change can be daunting, especially when you are past your twenties, and employers can get more skeptical of hiring and training you. However, when I passed my twenties and became more serious and intentional about my life and career, I decided to take the plunge and hope for the best. These are listed in no particular order.</p>
<h2 id="1-job-opportunities">#1 job opportunities</h2>
<p>IT has always been a field with many job opportunities, and with the current movements of digitalization and automation, there is no sign that it will slow down.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm">the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, “Employment in computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 13 percent from 2020 to 2030, faster than the average for all occupations. These occupations are projected to add about 667,600 new jobs. Demand for these workers will stem from greater emphasis on cloud computing, the collection and storage of big data, and information security.”</p>
<p>The situation is no different here in the Netherlands. Currently, there is a shortage of people in IT, and employers are much more willing to provide training to motivated individuals to make a change.</p>
<h2 id="2-remote-work">#2 remote work</h2>
<p>I think remote work is one of the best parts of living in post-pandemic 2022. I am an introvert, and having a quiet, stable space without distractions, which is the same from day to day, is a huge boost to my productivity.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think it is crucial to be mindful of your posture and body while working at a desk. For example, I am dependent on having a standing desk which I adjust more than ten times a day. I also need a chair suitable for my body type to avoid getting stiff and getting a sore back. Although some offices take care of providing these facilities to their employees, I think it is beneficial to invest in your own setup, which you can tailor to your own needs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, working from anywhere in the world is a massive advantage. I am not very interested in living a digital nomad lifestyle, working from a MacBook in coffee shops, but I think it’s great that you can spend some time abroad while working from that location.</p>
<h2 id="3-personal-interest">#3 personal interest</h2>
<p>This is a big one. You should not change your career to IT just because it earns well or because you think you can work from the beach in Thailand. I have been tinkering with computers and programming languages since I was a kid and have always enjoyed it. I always found myself “the computer guy” in groups of friends or colleagues.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, I never managed to make my career out of it until now, and I get a lot of satisfaction from my work every day after I made the change.</p>
<h2 id="4-high-income">#4 high income</h2>
<p>It is no secret that tech jobs are some of the best paying jobs in the U.S., having<a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#15-0000"> a mean wage of $99,860</a>. And if you work your way up into management, there are even higher salaries. Here <a href="https://www.nationaleberoepengids.nl/salaris/ict">in the Netherlands</a>, it is also a financially sound choice, with a mean wage of €47.200</p>
<h2 id="5-fast-changing-field">#5 fast-changing field</h2>
<p>IT is a broad field with many little niches you can get into, and every niche is constantly developing. Being in IT means you will need to stay on board by continuing to learn the new technologies and languages to keep on track.</p>
<p>This is also what makes it exciting to me, being a life-long learner. There is always more to learn and some cutting-edge technology to become familiar with, which can improve your workflow and your deployments.</p>
