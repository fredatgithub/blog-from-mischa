<p>I&rsquo;m a nerd. I use neovim for most of my text editing. I have a fully customized setup with dozens of custom keybindings so I can work a little more effectively. This blog is entirely written in neovim.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve built my custom setup in Arch Linux. I wrote <a href="/articles/linux-creativity">an article</a> about how customizing and maintaining my tailored operating system is a creative activity to me.</p>
<p>In the words of Rob Muhlenstein, <em>&ldquo;Using the Linux Bash terminal command-line is coding. Every command you type on every line is part of an interactive, ongoing program interpreted by Bash and processed by Linux.&rdquo;</em> Having this dialogue with the computer through commands and effects is one of the most fascinating things on this earth to me, and I feel fortunate that I can work with this every day as a DevOps engineer.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-blog">About this blog</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="/articles/jiro-sushi">in love with my work.</a> After I finish my day&rsquo;s work, I usually sit down to study more about my field. There is always something new to learn, and I always have a project and a course going.</p>
<p>I love to learn, and I love to write. I keep notes of the things I&rsquo;m learning and I decided to make a practice of publishing them on this blog.</p>
<p>Explaining things in my own words by writing articles about them is a great way to test my knowledge of a subject. Sometimes I even try to explain it as simple as possible, known as the Feynman technique.</p>
<p>Sometimes I write full articles on topics, sometimes they are smaller atomic notes.</p>
