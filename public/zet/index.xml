      <title>Application Insights: Telemetry Sampling</title>

      <description>Telemetry is the collection of measurements or other data at remote points, and transmitting that data to a receiver for monitoring.
Sampling is used to reduce telemetry traffic and costs for storage and data in Application Insights.
For small and medium sized applications sampling is generally not necessary.
Advantages of sampling:
Throttling data when the application suddenly sends a high volume of telemetry in a short time This saves costs! Keeping a pricing tier quota Reduce network traffic from telemetry collection Three different kinds of sampling:</description>

<p>Sampling is used to reduce telemetry traffic and costs for storage and data in Application Insights.</p>
<p>For small and medium sized applications sampling is generally not necessary.</p>
<p>Advantages of sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throttling data when the application suddenly sends a high volume of telemetry in a short time
<ul>
<li>This saves costs!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keeping a pricing tier quota</li>
<li>Reduce network traffic from telemetry collection</li>
</ul>
<p>Three different kinds of sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li>adaptive sampling
<ul>
<li>automatically adjusts volume of telemetry</li>
<li>from ASP.NET or Azure Functions</li>
<li>only for these two</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fixed-rate sampling
<ul>
<li>rate is set by the administrator</li>
<li>use when you have a clear idea of the appropriate sampling percentage</li>
<li>reduces volume from
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET or ASP.NET Core server</li>
<li>Java server</li>
<li>Python applications</li>
<li>User browsers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ingestion sampling
<ul>
<li>used when monthly quota is often met</li>
<li>reduces amount of processed and retained traffic by Application Insights
<ul>
<li>less processing = less cost</li>
<li>doesn&rsquo;t reduce telemetry traffic sent from the app</li>
<li>happens at Applications Insight service endpoint</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>disabled if SDK samples telemetry</li>
<li>can set sampling rate without redeploying the app</li>
<li>only applies when no other sampling is in effect
<ul>
<li>supports all Application Insights SDK&rsquo;s</li>

      <title>Pipelines: Continuous Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/pipelines-continuous-monitoring/</link>

      <description>This term can be confusing. Initially I thought it meant monitoring of the pipelines themselves. However, in the context of Azure Release Pipelines, continuous monitoring refers to something else.
Continuous monitoring leverages metrics from other services such as Application Insights. You can set up release gates based on these metrics. For example, you can set up a release gate to roll back the deployment if an alert is being fired for high CPU usage in the application.</description>

<p>You can set up several of these checks. If all these checks pass, the pipeline can proceed.</p>

      <title>Distributed Tracing</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/distributed-tracing/</link>

      <description>Debugging is done using call stacks in monolithic applications. Nowadays it is more common to deploy an application using a microservices architecture. Microservices make it easier to update certain parts of the application, and allow for more frequent deployments.
Using microservices does have a disadvantage: you cannot use the local call stack for debugging, because calls are sent to different microservices.
Distributed tracing is an implementation of the call stack in the cloud.</description>

      <title>What is a SDK?</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/sdk/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 07:50:55 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/sdk/</guid>
      <description>A software development kit (SDK) is a set of tools provided by the manufacturer of (usually) a hardware platform, operating system (OS), or programming language.
SDKs contain all the tools you need to get started. They typically contain a compiler, a debugger and an API. But they can also contain documentation and testing tools.</description>

      <description>When you call a function, the system sets aside space in memory for the function to do its work. Those chunks are called &amp;ldquo;stack frames&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;function frames.&amp;rdquo;
These frames are arranged in a stack. The frame for the most recently called function is always at the top of the stack. When a new function is called, it becomes the active frame, and it is on top of the stack.</description>

<p>These frames are arranged in a stack. The frame for the most recently called function is always at the top of the stack. When a new function is called, it becomes the active frame, and it is on top of the stack.</p>
<p>The function that is actually doing something at the moment is on top of the stack and is known as the &ldquo;active frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the function finishes its work, the frame is popped off of the stack. The frame in second place becomes the active frame. It had been paused in the meantime, and now it is active again, because it is on top.</p>
<p>Functions that are not on top, are not running.</p>

      <title>Starting a Project</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting a project with a friend. Developing an application. We make a good team, he&amp;rsquo;s great at coding and knows the backend too.
He&amp;rsquo;ll do the development, I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of hosting. We&amp;rsquo;re setting everything up in Azure DevOps, so it is a great way to practice my Azure skills and apply the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in my recently obtained AZ-104 Azure Administrator certification.
Even though it is a small scale hobby project, I still plan to approach it as if it was an enterprise production application.</description>

<p>Even though it is a small scale hobby project, I still plan to approach it as if it was an enterprise production application. I&rsquo;ll set up a full CI/CD pipeline with testing in a secure manner. Credentials stored in an Azure key vault and images pushed to a private registry.</p>
<p>This is going to be fun!</p>

      <title>Going to Publish Smaller, and More Often</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/move-to-zet/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve transitioned my note taking system towards a Zettelkasten system. I still use directories for folders and make copious links, but more often than not I put them in the larger generic 00-zettelkasten directory in my Obsidian vault.
The concept of &amp;ldquo;atomic notes&amp;rdquo; is also very important in Zettelkasten methods. Notes should be small and concise.
Up until this point I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing full articles on my blog. I came across Rob Muhlestein yesterday and I was very inspired by his setup and public zettelkasten.</description>

<p>Up until this point I&rsquo;ve been publishing full articles on my blog. I came across <a href="https://github.com/rwxrob">Rob Muhlestein</a> yesterday and I was very inspired by his setup and public zettelkasten. I think I&rsquo;ll move to a similar approach. Still planning to write and publish full articles as well, but also including atomic notes and personal status updates.</p>
