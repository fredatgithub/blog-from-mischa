      <description>Recently I was comparing apps for navigation (TopoGPS and Outdooractive). Both apps are great, but the main perk of Outdooractive is that it has a web interface. You can plan routes from your computer and access them on the iPhone app, but TopoGPS is on the iPhone only.
The app I probably have the most interaction with during the day is my calorie tracking app. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using YAZIO for about two years and it has been satisfactory, but there were a few small annoyances to the app and I was never completely satisfied with.</description>

<p>The app I probably have the most interaction with during the day is my calorie tracking app. I&rsquo;ve been using YAZIO for about two years and it has been satisfactory, but there were a few small annoyances to the app and I was never completely satisfied with.</p>
<p>A missing web interface being one of them. I&rsquo;d love to be able to sit behind my 4K screen and plan out the week&rsquo;s nutrition from there instead of using the clunky copy function on my phone.</p>
<p>Enter MyFitnessPal. It has a web interface. It has charts and graphs. Me happy.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t I chose this app when I began using an app for my phone? I remember trying it out, but I was unhappy with it somehow. I remember something about the food database not containing the foods I was eating at the time. I&rsquo;ve been doing some testing and up until now I haven&rsquo;t had to add any foods.</p>
<p>I have a year&rsquo;s subscription on YAZIO until March so it is a bit of a waste, but I&rsquo;m already sold on the web interface of MFP. I have one free month of premium and I&rsquo;ll make the decision then.</p>

      <description>I always thought everybody responded to stress by eating more. I was surprised to learn that many people actually stop eating when they are stressed out. This seems totally foreign to me, and this might also be why I have always been overweight.

<ul>
<li>Stress takes enormous amoutns of resources in the body</li>
<li>Especially ATP</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a well documented relationship between stress response and obesity. Many obese people have a higher stress response, and they have become accustomed to dealing with this stress response through eating.</p>
<p>Manifests as huge cravings for food which can be nearly impossible to manage, leading to binge eating.</p>
<p>There are two types of people: people who stop eating when stressed and people who start to crave when stressed.</p>
<p>(I am definitely in the second cateogry without a doubt.)</p>
<p>These people have problems with satiety, cannot feel satiated and have eating disorders. They benefit from mindful eating practices and getting in touch with the physiological response to food.</p>
