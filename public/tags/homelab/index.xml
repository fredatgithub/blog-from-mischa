      <title>Homelab Secret Management With GitOps and Azure Key Vault</title>

      <description>In this blog post, I want to share with you how I set up secrets management for my home lab. I use my home lab to explore new technologies, but I also try to keep it in line with the practices I would use when setting up environments for clients. I focus on Microsoft Azure and the ecosystem they provide for cloud native applications. Secrets management is an important aspect of any cloud-native application, as it allows you to securely store and access sensitive information such as passwords, tokens and certificates.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this blog post, I want to share with you how I set up secrets management for my <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/homelab/">home lab</a>. I use my home lab to explore new technologies, but I also try to keep it in line with the practices I would use when setting up environments for clients. I focus on Microsoft Azure and the ecosystem they provide for cloud native applications. Secrets management is an important aspect of any cloud-native application, as it allows you to securely store and access sensitive information such as passwords, tokens and certificates.</p>
<p>Since Flux is the integrated solution for GitOps in Azure Kubernetes Service I also adopted it for my home lab. Flux supports and recommends encrypting secrets in git using SOPS, which is a tool that uses asymmetric encryption to protect secrets. This means that you can store encrypted secrets in your git repository and only decrypt them when they are applied to the cluster. This sounds like a convenient and secure way to manage secrets, right?</p>
<p>Well, not quite. After doing some research, I decided to use a different approach: storing my secrets in Azure Key Vault and syncing them to my cluster with the Azure Key Vault Provider. This is the recommended best practice by Microsoft, as explained in this article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: Referencing secrets in an external key vault is the recommended approach. It is easier to orchestrate secret rotation and more scalable with multiple clusters and/or teams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/continuous-delivery/gitops/secret-management/secret-management-gitops/">https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/continuous-delivery/gitops/secret-management/secret-management-gitops/</a></p>
<p>SOPS has some drawbacks that made me choose the Azure Key Vault route for my home lab. First of all, SOPS requires you to encrypt each secret value manually in the command line, which can be tedious and error-prone. Secondly, SOPS relies on a single encryption key that is stored in your local machine or in a cloud KMS. If you lose this key, you will lose access to all your encrypted secrets in your Git repo. Thirdly, SOPS does not provide a backup or recovery mechanism for your secrets, nor does it offer fine-grained access control or auditing capabilities.</p>
<p>Here are some of the reasons why I chose this approach over SOPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secrets are stored in an external source, which means that they are not exposed in git, even if encrypted.</li>
<li>Azure Key Vault provides backup and recovery features, such as soft delete and restore, which can help in case of accidental deletion or corruption of secrets.</li>
<li>Azure Key Vault allows fine-grained authentication and authorization to the vaults, using Entra ID identities and policies. This means that I can control who can access or modify my secrets, and audit their actions.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t need to encrypt or decrypt values in the command line, which can be error-prone or leak information. I can use the Azure CLI or the Azure Portal to manage my secrets in the vault.</li>
<li>If I lose my encryption key, all my encrypted secrets in git are useless with SOPS. With Azure Key Vault, I can still access my secrets using my Entra ID or recover them from backup.</li>
<li>This approach mimics a solution that I would use for an enterprise production environment</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this does not mean that I will not use SOPS at all. Sometimes Helm charts or other configurations need values to be hardcoded due to incorrect implementation. This is where SOPS truly shines. You can safely check in your secret values to source code. Additionally, the SOPS keys can also be stored in Azure Key Vault. Tools should be used where they are most useful, so I&rsquo;m not saying I won&rsquo;t use SOPS at all, but I&rsquo;m choosing Azure Key Vaults and the accompanying CSI Store provider for my main solution.</p>
<h1 id="azure-key-vault-provider">Azure Key Vault Provider</h1>
<p>To sync my secrets from Azure Key Vault to my AKS cluster, I used the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver. This is an open source project that enables you to mount secrets from external sources (such as Azure Key Vault) as volumes in your pods using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) specification.</p>
<p>I followed <a href="https://azure.github.io/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-azure/docs/">the provider documentation</a> to install the provider in my local cluster using a Flux HelmRelease.</p>
<p>With the provider installed I can use the following configuration to sync a secret named grafana-admin-password from my Key Vault and make it available as a volume and environment variable in an example busybox pod:</p>

      <description>This week I started a project which I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off for too long. I finally started my homelab. Over the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting hardware here and there, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had the intention to start up a proper Kubernetes cluster at home. I got inspired by Rob Muhlenstein&amp;rsquo;s Homelab Init playlist on YouTube which I&amp;rsquo;m working on.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I started a project which I&rsquo;ve been putting off for too long. I finally started my homelab. Over the past year I&rsquo;ve been collecting hardware here and there, and I&rsquo;ve had the intention to start up a proper Kubernetes cluster at home. I got inspired by Rob Muhlenstein&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrK9UeDMcQLpjUGg5z9Z6Un-axVx06-2J">Homelab Init</a> playlist on YouTube which I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why I haven&rsquo;t started up until now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focused on switching jobs and certifications</li>
<li>Not knowing what to run on the cluster</li>
<li>High electricity costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I found a new job with a great employer, I&rsquo;ve changed my focus towards doing more hands-on learning in my free time by learning Go and diving deeper into Cloud Native technology. Energy prices have come down in the meantime as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve reached a stage in my Go learning journey where I&rsquo;m actually able to start making small deployable applications, and I want an environment where I can do that without high costs or without fearing to break something. I want to learn more about databases on Kubernetes, and I want to start writing small microservices and API&rsquo;s that are able to query these databases.</p>
<p>My lab is going to be my playground, where I can deploy whatever I want and learn the technologies that interest me at that particular moment.</p>
<h1 id="hardware-parts">Hardware: Parts</h1>
<p>For some reason the Raspberry Pi has become synonymous with homelabs. I get that it&rsquo;s fun to run a cluster on something that is not much larger than a 1kg pack of sugar. But I never really caught on to that whole scene yet. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a bit late to the party and the Pi&rsquo;s have been scarce and very expensive lately?</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ve been thankfully accepting old computers that friends were going to get rid of, and I&rsquo;ve been keeping some of my own old hardware as well. I have enough motherboards and other parts to assemble around 3 nodes, which will probably have around 8GB RAM each, but possibilities to attach storage.</p>
<p>This is also what has been keeping me back for a while I think. There is quite a bit of work that I need to do to get these machines going, and probably I&rsquo;ll have to purchase a couple of other parts. However, I also have some functional hardware.</p>
<h2 id="gaming-desktop">Gaming Desktop</h2>
<p>I have an old gaming desktop with 16GB RAM, an Intel 6700K Skylake, 1070 video card and a couple of TB of storage.</p>
<p>This has been my Arch Linux desktop for the past year, but now that I switched to my new MacBook, I&rsquo;m not using it as much. I want to keep it as it is right now, but I could run a few Virtual Machines on there, and maybe consider turning it into a ProxMox server.</p>
<h2 id="old-laptops">Old Laptops</h2>
<p>I have two old laptops. One Asus with 4GB of RAM and a Thinkpad T430 with 8GB RAM. The Thinkpad is actually surprisingly powerful. As a weekend project I installed Arch on it and I fitted it with a refurbished keyboard, and it is a very pleasant machine to work with. However, now that I have a very powerful laptop that I use as a desktop and portable device, it has become redundant.</p>
<h1 id="old-laptops-as-raspberri-pis">Old Laptops as Raspberri Pi&rsquo;s</h1>
<p>Having these two old laptops lying around, it occurred to me that these machines were basically Raspberri Pi&rsquo;s with a large form factor and a higher power usage. Why would I need to spend hundreds of euros on these smaller computers if I could just use these laptops as a starting point for my lab?</p>
<p>Using laptops has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>No additional costs</li>
<li>No building needed</li>
<li>Easy to install Linux on them</li>
<li>Built-in screen and keyboard for quick access when SSH does not work out</li>
<li>Built-in batteries to handle short power disruptions (rare but possible)</li>
<li>Can get going very quickly</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="choices-and-goals">Choices and Goals</h1>
<h2 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h2>
<p>The first goal is to get a Kubernetes cluster running. I will do bare metal kubeadm installs, and later I want to learn more about Talos. Fortunately I feel very comfortable installing Kubernetes with kubeadm. I did plenty of practice for my CKA, and I recently installed it on free Oracle VM&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve experimented a bit with K9S earlier, but I want to learn how to maintain on-prem Kubernetes.</p>
<p>My goals is to learn to maintain production-grade clusters properly.</p>
<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>Naturally I&rsquo;ll be using Linux as my base OS. After some consideration I chose to use Ubuntu Server 22. Some notes on that choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>I already have years of Ubuntu Server experience</li>
<li>Good to keep building on what I have</li>
<li>Working with managed Kubernetes on my day job requires me to keep Linux admin skills fresh</li>
<li>Still the <a href="https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/linux-statistics.html">most popular Linux distro</a></li>
<li>Google uses Ubuntu Server</li>
<li>Well documented and plenty of questions on StackOverflow</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="infrastructure-as-code--gitops">Infrastructure as Code &amp; GitOps</h2>
<p>Initially I&rsquo;ll configure the servers by hand, but I want to have the server configuration as code as Ansible playbooks eventually. However, I&rsquo;ll be using ArgoCD for all of my deployments on Kubernetes itself, so the server configuration is only a very small part of the setup. Just get Kubernetes running and do the rest with ArgoCD.</p>
<p>Perhaps I will expand with larger servers that run multiple VM&rsquo;s. Then it will be very relevant to start provisioning these with Ansible.</p>
<h2 id="networking">Networking</h2>
<p>I want to learn more about networking and use static IP addresses for my servers. I need to figure out how my home network works exactly. Surprisingly, I&rsquo;ve never taken the effort to actually know how the devices on my network get their IP addresses and how they communicate, even though I&rsquo;ve learned plenty about it for my day job and do networking in an enterprise environment daily.</p>
<p>For Kubernetes I&rsquo;ll use Flannel to start out with, but I want to learn more about Cilium, Istio and other service mesh implementations.</p>
<p>Another goal is to host my own DNS server for internal name resolution, probably CoreDNS.</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>I want to host my own container registry (Harbor) and use Tekton pipelines to for CI/CD, and I&rsquo;m playing with the thought to host my own GitLab instance as well.</p>
<h1 id="lets-go">Let&rsquo;s Go!</h1>
<p>Another realization was that I don&rsquo;t need to have everything figured out before I begin. The beauty of cluster computing is that you can add to it as you go. I can start with a small cluster of two nodes and build it out as my needs grow. I don&rsquo;t expect to need more than a few GB of RAM in the foreseeable future, so these two laptops will be plenty to get going.</p>
