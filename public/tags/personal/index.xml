      <title>Decided to split up into a technical and personal blog after all</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with this ever since I started blogging 2 years ago (can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s already been that long). But I&amp;rsquo;ve finally made the decision: I&amp;rsquo;m keeping this blog at mischavandenburg.com as a tech and career focused blog where I share technical knowledge and notes, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new personal blog at mischavandenburg.blog.
I have fallen in love with blogging. Documenting my own life in writing has become a very therapeutic and valuable experience to me.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling with this ever since I started blogging 2 years ago (can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s already been that long). But I&rsquo;ve finally made the decision: I&rsquo;m keeping this blog at mischavandenburg.com as a tech and career focused blog where I share technical knowledge and notes, and I&rsquo;m starting a new personal blog at <a href="https://mischavandenburg.blog">mischavandenburg.blog</a>.</p>
<p>I have fallen in love with blogging. Documenting my own life in writing has become a very therapeutic and valuable experience to me. Even if nobody reads what I put out into the world, it is incredibly satisfying to scroll through your own blog and go back in time to see what I was learning or doing or feeling at that time.</p>
<p>Blogging is an expression of creativity to me. My fingers move on the keyboard and an article appears. I&rsquo;m creating text. I&rsquo;m not a visual person, unfortunately. I don&rsquo;t see images when I think and I&rsquo;m rather bad at drawing or arranging things in a pleasing way. Throughout my life I have expressed my creativity in music, but I consciously haven&rsquo;t engaged in making music in the past few years because it takes up so much time in practice. But I have found a very rewarding way of expressing myself in writing by blogging.</p>
<p>However, I feel that I am constraining myself on this blog because it is is linked to my LinkedIn account and I keep posting to LinkedIn from here. Even though I have nothing to hide, I&rsquo;m pouring my thoughts out on the internet after all, I do feel that LinkedIn is best kept as a professional platform where people can expect consistency and a focus on technical topics, even when they navigate away from there to my own blog.</p>
<p>But I have so much more to give. I want to write about topics that deeply interest me: meditation, Buddhism, running, plant-based diet, healthy living, longevity, mental health, addiction. I feel the urge to pour out these thoughts freely in a place I can call my home on the web, without feeling any restraint or concern. That&rsquo;s why I gave my new blog the headline <strong>&ldquo;A place where I can truly be free&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>Another reason why I&rsquo;m splitting it off is because I intend to use this blog in the process of becoming a Microsoft MVP. The achievement of that goal was not in my mind when I started blogging about personal topics on this blog, but now I think it will be best to keep this blog clean and technical in order to present a clear image in the MVP approval process.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about SEO or ads or the amount of views this blog gets. It&rsquo;s not about SEO optimization or having to have a niche. I&rsquo;m more concerned with giving any readers a good experience as possible.</p>
<p>So here we go. This blog has a (re)new(ed) technical focus, and I&rsquo;m going to keep sharing my notes, learnings, AKS and Azure updates and other discoveries I make along the way. But I&rsquo;ll also be migrating away the personal posts on running, weeknotes and other posts away from this blog.</p>
<p>If you are interested in my personal ramblings though, make sure to check out my new personal blog here:</p>

      <title>I&#39;m not journaling as often as I used to</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/not-journaling-as-often/</link>

      <description>I notice that I&amp;rsquo;m not writing in my journal every day like I used to. I always wrote down what I did, what I felt, what my plans and ambitions were, every single day.
During my holiday I started writing by hand in a notebook again which was really nice. It felt good to feel the pencil scratching on the paper again and to practice my cursive writing.
After I came back I first tried to keep journaling by hand again, but after a few days the journal remained untouched.</description>

<p>During my holiday I started writing by hand in a notebook again which was really nice. It felt good to feel the pencil scratching on the paper again and to practice my cursive writing.</p>
<p>After I came back I first tried to keep journaling by hand again, but after a few days the journal remained untouched. I figured I would go back to my usual digital journaling again by writing daily notes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a litlte intruiged. I do feel very relaxed and at ease, perhaps I do not need to write so much at this time? Writing down frustrations and feelings definitely has been a certain way of processing them.</p>
<p>And perhaps my routine is reaching such a degree of stability that it is simply not worth the effort of writing it all down all the time.</p>
<p>Rather than writing in my personal notes, I do have the intention to write more zets in my public zettelkasten on all the topics that interest me currently. Micronotes.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished my last workday and tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m heading off to Norway! When I glance at the amount of posts I&amp;rsquo;ve made on my blog recently it&amp;rsquo;s obvious that it is time for a break from the entire routine. I&amp;rsquo;ve been tapering down to this moment for a while now, toning down the studying and prioritizing relaxation so I can enter the holidays with a clear mind.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s time for lots of fresh air, mountains, many kilometres on the trails, and to pick up the connection to Nature I&amp;rsquo;ve made during the 9 years that I lived in the beautiful North.</description>

      <description>Why bother with a personal website? Why not just write blog posts on LinkedIn?
I want to own my data. I want to have complete freedom. I want to write whatever I want.
This post captures it beautifully.

      <title>8 Simple Japanese Habits</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/8-simple-japanese-habits/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/8-simple-japanese-habits/</guid>
      <description>Through YouTube I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to quite a bit of Japanese culture and I love many aspects of it. I love this list of habits, and I was surprised to see how many of them I already incorporate.
Clean the Toilet Many successful businessmen clean the toilet every day. It humbles you. Ajahn Chah also talks about this a lot. Check out &amp;ldquo;Toilets on the Path&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m also very focused on cleanliness and especially emphasize keeping my toilet clean.</description>

<p>Through YouTube I&rsquo;ve been exposed to quite a bit of Japanese culture and I love many aspects of it. I love this list of habits, and I was surprised to see how many of them I already incorporate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean the Toilet</li>
</ol>
<p>Many successful businessmen clean the toilet every day. It humbles you. Ajahn Chah also talks about this a lot. Check out &ldquo;Toilets on the Path&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m also very focused on cleanliness and especially emphasize keeping my toilet clean. But I like the idea of cleaning it every day and I&rsquo;m going to give it a try.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Put your shoes away neatly</li>
</ol>
<p>Just look at how clean that looks in the video! Fortunately I also have a habit of putting them neatly on a rack I have.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Improve your posture</li>
</ol>
<p>Investing in my Herman Miller chair has been a huge improvement to my life, and combined with yoga my posture has improved a lot over the past few months. I walk more upright and find myself correcting posture more often than before.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Thanking for meals</li>
</ol>
<p>Being grateful for all people who were involved in making that meal. The farmers, the cooks, everybody.</p>
<p>Being grateful for life.</p>
<p>I can definitely improve on this and appreciate my food more.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Put the chair back after you use it</li>
</ol>
<p>Japanese people are very concerned with other people&rsquo;s feelings. Putting a chair back in a restaurant you will make the restaurant staff happy, for example. I&rsquo;m usually quite considerate about these things and generally want to make the world a better place. I have a habit of thinking, &ldquo;how can I make this person&rsquo;s day a little better?&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Appreciate the things you already have</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look at the things you don&rsquo;t have, but look at what you already have.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Okage Samade</li>
</ol>
<p>A phrase that means something to the effect of &ldquo;I am good because of all the people that suppport me&rdquo;. Used when someone asks &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Going to bed early and waking up early.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is absolutely true. I get up at 6 every day. At 10pm I usually start winding down for bed and lights are off at 23:00. I&rsquo;ve also gone through long periods of getting up at 4 or 3am, and I felt great doing so. I&rsquo;m currenlty using 6am because I sometimes have social engagements that prevent me from going to bed very early.</p>

      <title>AI Does Not Grow Exponentially, Thus, Less Scary</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/ai-does-not-grow-exponentially/</link>

      <description>I watch the whole AI craze from the sideline: I am interested in it but I do not spend a lot of time investigating it. But I do pick up a few things here and there.
In this Rich Roll podcast, Kevin Kelly argues that AI does not grow exponentially. It grows linearly, but not exponentially, because it is constrained by the infrastrucutre that we give it, and are able to give it.</description>

<p>In this Rich Roll podcast, Kevin Kelly argues that AI does not grow exponentially. It grows linearly, but not exponentially, because it is constrained by the infrastrucutre that we give it, and are able to give it. AI cannot grow by itself. We simply cannot provide enough computing power to enable exponential growth because the technology is not advanced enough yet, which means the growth is stunted.</p>
<p>This makes the doomsday image of an all-powerful single AI that takes over the world and exterminates all humans a lot less likely.</p>

      <title>Invest In Experiences For Happiness</title>

      <description>Happiness, Hedonic Adjustment, Experiences This was a very good video. I can honestly say that I am very happy and content, and I lead a very fulfilling life. I do not usually watch this kind of &amp;ldquo;happiness&amp;rdquo; content because I&amp;rsquo;m already happy. But this video did give me some very important insights which have influenced the way I approach money and happiness.
Memories as Dividends The main takeaway for me is to prioritize creating memories by investing in experiences.</description>

<h1 id="happiness-hedonic-adjustment-experiences">Happiness, Hedonic Adjustment, Experiences</h1>
<p>This was a very good video. I can honestly say that I am very happy and content, and I lead a very fulfilling life. I do not usually watch this kind of &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; content because I&rsquo;m already happy. But this video did give me some very important insights which have influenced the way I approach money and happiness.</p>
<h1 id="memories-as-dividends">Memories as Dividends</h1>
<p>The main takeaway for me is to prioritize creating memories by investing in experiences. The author phrases it very well here:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you buy a shiny new car, every time you use it that shine wears of just a little bit. You hedonically adjust. With a memory, every time you think about it, you experience joy. Your brain cements the pathway to that memory, and you relive it in your brain, experiencing feelings of happines or nostalgia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hedonic adjustment happens when you become used to the things you like, and you need to have bigger and better things in order to get the same satisfaction. The Stoics, among others, counteracted this with forced deprivation: eating plain bread for a few days will make you appreciate your customary food.</p>
<p>Another very clever point which Damien makes is to see money spent on experiences as dividends:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Experiences and memories in this way are like investments in happiness, because we can call on them to release the happiness hormones in our brains that make us feel good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They can be seen as happiness dividends. You get the initial experience and you get to re-live it again and again. And the best thing is that you don&rsquo;t hedonically adjust to these memories.</p>
<p>This definitely made me re-think my approach to fincancial happiness and independence. I am definitely going to prioritize experiences a lot more in the future.</p>
<h1 id="other-takeaways">Other Takeaways</h1>
<ul>
<li>Variety and anticipation of events or smaller purchases provides a large portion of the happiness, rather than the purchase itself</li>
<li>Make many smaller purchases rather than one big purchase</li>
<li>Take short weekend holidays rather than a big expensive 4 week holiday</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="norway">Norway</h1>
<p>A case in point is my upcoming trip to Norway. Ever since I decided on the date for the trip, I noticed my energy has increased because I&rsquo;m excited about the trip. I&rsquo;m getting a lot of joy out of the anticipation: I&rsquo;m reading up on areas to visit, going through all of my outdoor gear, and getting out into nature more because I want to connect to that Norwegian part of me. This is all rooted very deeply within me because I lived there for 9 years, and the anticipation of returning to Norway for a short time gives me so much joy.</p>
<p>By taking time off and purchasing the necesseties for my trip, I&rsquo;m investing in experiences that will create memories which in turn will provide me more happiness in the future as dividends.</p>

      <description>I ran 10k for the first time in my life today.
I ran to the beach and back in Heemskerk on hardened forest roads, listening to the birds and feeling the spring sun on my face. I felt great and had a smile on my face most of the time. Lots of interesting thoughts popping up in the mind as I run and reflect. Hardly noticed that 77 minutes went by because I was having such a good time.</description>

      <description>With the spring finally being fully released on the Netherlands, my wanderlust has awakened again after lying dormant for two years. In my 9 years in Norway I became a seasoned outdoorsman spending much time roaming the mountains and forests and always spending days or weeks out in the wild with my tent.
When I moved back to the Netherlands this has been put on hold for a couple of years while I focused on changing my career on IT.</description>

In my 9 years in Norway I became a seasoned outdoorsman spending much time roaming the mountains and forests and always spending days or weeks out in the wild with my tent.</p>
<p>When I moved back to the Netherlands this has been put on hold for a couple of years while I focused on changing my career on IT. Now that the career is rolling along nicely by the looks of it, I&rsquo;m super excited to start exploring the Netherlands and see what the outdoors life is like in an area where the nature is significantly less wild and abundant.</p>
<p>I needed a solution to post pictures quickly and easily because I want to start logging my trips as well. My hugo setup is great for text and techincal content but I need something where I can easily post straight from my phone and Tumblr seems like the best option. I&rsquo;ll also be posting more on Instagram from here on out.</p>
<p>Here is my first post:</p>

      <title>Why I&#39;m Posting More on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/why-post-on-social-media/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/why-post-on-social-media/</guid>
      <description>My recent post on E/N blogging led to a realization: posting on social media will be something I do for myself, instead of doing it for others.
When Facebook came out when I was 16 I posted quite a lot on social media. 5 years later I found it very embarassing to read back through those posts and I deleted everything, and since then I have been been holding back on social media posting and deleting my accounts several times.</description>

<p>When Facebook came out when I was 16 I posted quite a lot on social media. 5 years later I found it very embarassing to read back through those posts and I deleted everything, and since then I have been been holding back on social media posting and deleting my accounts several times.</p>
<p>In the meantime I also used social media as a marketing tool, creating very specific accounts tailored to a particular niche of content to drive traffic to websites. This approach to social media broke my relationship with it, and it became something you do to gain a certain response from others. I think this is the case for many people. Whether it is getting as much as possible likes, or getting people to click on an affiliate link, your content is always shaped by your anticipation of the audience&rsquo;s reaction.</p>
<p>Starting this blog has been a breakthrough for me. Especially when I gave up on my tech niche and just started writing about everything that interests me, it became a huge enrichment to my life, and I&rsquo;m going to extend this to social media as well.</p>
<p>The thing is, I&rsquo;ve always been very bad at taking pictures and storing them. I have tons of great experiences and memories stored in my mind, but I sometimes wish that I took more pictures of these adventures. Because I was lucky enough to have grown up in an an age without smartphones, there still is an inherent reluctance towards that whole culture. There is an irritation when I see people flipping out their phones when their meals get served in a restaurant, and I feel socially awkward to take my phone out in public to take pictures of things.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m changing this: I&rsquo;m going to take more pictures of the things I experience and post them on social media. Not because I want to impress others, but because I want to record the things I&rsquo;m doing so I can enjoy them again at a later time. I arrived at this desire because I find it very enjoyable to scroll through my own blog and see the progression I&rsquo;ve made over time, and the things I decided to share. And I want to extend this experience to pictures as well. So I&rsquo;m going to post more on Instagram and Tumblr and write short travel logs of the places I visit and the things I experience, so I can revisit them later and find pleasure therein.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically using these services to my own needs and completely disregard any audience. But if anybody finds enjoyment in seeing the things I put online, that would be a great thing.</p>

      <title>My Blog Is Turning Into And Everything / Nothing Website And It Feels Good</title>

      <description>Read an interesting post this morning about E/N websites. Apparently a phenomenon from the early days of the web, E/N websites meant everything to the publisher, but maybe nothing to the rest of the world. The term may have been the predecessor of the term &amp;ldquo;weblog&amp;rdquo; which was shortened to blog.
E/N description: The website&amp;rsquo;s author covers a myriad of topics. It&amp;rsquo;s not narrowly focused. The author writes about everything or at least everything that&amp;rsquo;s important to the author.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Read an interesting post this morning about <a href="http://sawv.org/en.html">E/N websites.</a> Apparently a phenomenon from the early days of the web, E/N websites meant everything to the publisher, but maybe nothing to the rest of the world. The term may have been the predecessor of the term &ldquo;weblog&rdquo; which was shortened to blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E/N description: The website&rsquo;s author covers a myriad of topics. It&rsquo;s not narrowly focused. The author writes about everything or at least everything that&rsquo;s important to the author. The site might contain something useful for anyone who visits. The content means everything to the publisher, but it could mean nothing to the rest of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="/zet/articles/write-about-health-personal/">this post from March</a> I declared that I would write more about my personal life and expanding the range of topics that I would publish on my blog / zettelkasten. And it has a great decision so far.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy the sense of freedom it has given me. Rather than constraining myself to one subject area, I feel free to write about anything that currently interests me. Writing about these topics stimulates further research and more intentional content consumption.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing more and more personal content, and this is the type of content one might expect to be seen on a social media platform. I don&rsquo;t use social media much, and decided to carve out my own space on the internet and write there instead. I will always be the owner of this content, and I can write about whatever I want and change the appearance and presentation.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain why, but there is something very satisfying about scrolling through my <a href="/archives/">archives</a> and seeing the things that caught my interest during those particular months, knowing that it is publically available and that others might be piqued by the keywords as well.</p>
<p>Discovering <a href="https://roytang.net/">Roy Tang&rsquo;s website</a> was also very inspirational. I picked up the idea of sharing my week notes and logging the content consumption from his blog. Reading Hacker News regularly has exposed me to several personal blogs which I&rsquo;ve added to my RSS feeds, and I enjoy reading about their interests and getting inspiration from what they decide to publish on their blogs.</p>

      <title>My Plan For The D2R Ladder Reset</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/d2r-ladder-reset-may-2023/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>Diablo 2: one of those games in life I keep returning to. Started playing it when I was 12, and I know it inside out. Roughly once every 1,5 years I&amp;rsquo;ll have a phase where I want to play some.
I&amp;rsquo;m in such a phase right now. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been gaming since the Victoria 3 release, and frankly, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much time to spend either. Something will be sacrificed. Currently this will be study time.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diablo 2: one of those games in life I keep returning to. Started playing it when I was 12, and I know it inside out. Roughly once every 1,5 years I&rsquo;ll have a phase where I want to play some.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in such a phase right now. I haven&rsquo;t been gaming since the Victoria 3 release, and frankly, I don&rsquo;t have much time to spend either. Something will be sacrificed. Currently this will be study time. I&rsquo;ve been studying for several hours a day for nearly two years, but with my current increased focus on health and weight loss, I feel I need a break and allow myself some leasure.</p>
<p>Diablo 2 Resurrected will reset tomorrow and I&rsquo;ve been doing a little bit of research to get up to speed on the new Terror Zones and possible character builds. I think it&rsquo;s so lovely that Blizzard came out with Diablo 2 Resurrected 1,5 years ago, and that they&rsquo;re still adding new content to a nearly 20 year old game.</p>
<h1 id="terror-zones">Terror Zones</h1>
<p>An interesting addition to the game which will change end game levelling. From what I&rsquo;ve read, they are suited to farm solo from level 92 or so. Up until then Dia/Baal runs are still most efficient.</p>
<h1 id="builds">Builds</h1>
<p>One of the new interesting build possibilities in D2R is the Fire Druid. When D2R was launched I played an Trap assassin and a barbarian, so it will be fun to try something new. I haven&rsquo;t built a druid in many years, so I look forward to that.</p>
<p>I also considered doing a war cry barbarian, javazon or summon necromancer. But the fire druid appeals most to me currently.</p>
<h1 id="ladder">Ladder</h1>
<p>My plan is to just build one character, and I think I&rsquo;ll keep doing that in the future. When I feel like joining a ladder reset I&rsquo;ll just do one character, play it through the game, do some end game farming, and by then I&rsquo;ll probably be finished with Diablo for a while again.</p>
<h1 id="druid-strategy">Druid Strategy</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be playing through the game in public games. Like every reset there will be a flood of cold sorceresses, so my fire damage will be a good addition to any party. From what I&rsquo;ve seen, the fire druid does a ton of damage with hardly any gear, so I probably won&rsquo;t have to much low level farming. I&rsquo;ll just focus on playing through the game asap and do any farming in hell difficulty.</p>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p>Str for gear, rest vita.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>1 point Oak Sage, and take some summons to get to grizzly. Aim for grizzly by nightmare. But don&rsquo;t prioritize. I&rsquo;ll be playing with parties, so probably not much need for summons, and I&rsquo;ll probably have to re-cast them all the time anyway which might actually be annoying. Maybe better to just focus on the fire skills.</p>
<p>Figure out which attack skill I like. Fissure can be fine through all of nightmare.</p>
<p>Alzorath&rsquo;s maxing path:</p>
<p>Fissure
Armageddon
Molten Boulder
Volcano
Firestorm</p>
<p>Cyclone armor: wait until you have a lot of + skills. So don&rsquo;t bother</p>
<h3 id="use-quick-cast">Use quick cast</h3>
<p>The quick cast feature is something new to me. As an old school player I was resistant to this feature. But from what I&rsquo;ve seen, it seems very effective with the fire skills.</p>
<h2 id="gear">Gear</h2>
<p>Tal Eth Stealth breast plate.</p>
<p>Ort Sol Lore. Save a 2soc druid helm for this</p>
<p>Buy 2soc staff tir ral at Akara asap.</p>
<p>Dual spirits</p>
<p>Magefist</p>
<h3 id="later-gear">Later gear</h3>
<p>Rain Armor
Ort Mal Ith</p>
<p>Ravenlore</p>

      <title>Saw Sabaton Live Yesterday!</title>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/sabaton-concert-2023/</guid>
      <description>Had a great time at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam yesterday. Went to see Sabaton live. This was my second time seeing them live, and it was a great show.
I love Sabaton because all of their material revolves around history and warfare. They are one of my favourite bands. I was super happy they played some of my favourite songs: &amp;ldquo;Carolus Rex&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Stormtroopers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;To Hell And Back&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a lover of metal music ever since childhood, but I had a break from metal music for about 5 years where I hardly listened to any music at all.</description>

<p>I believe the last live show I saw was Cannibal Corpse in 2014 in Oslo. Nearly 10 years without a metal concert?!</p>

      <title>Vacations In The Soviet Union</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/vacations-in-soviet-union/</link>

      <description>Read an interesting article this morning. Apparently the Soviet Union introduced paid time off well before other industrialized countries.
Interestingly, but not unexpectedly, the state determined how and with whom you spent that vacation.
As members of a collective, citizens were expected to spend their free time in a manner the government and its leading theorists considered beneficial to society as whole, regardless of an individual’s preferences.
Ever since the 1930s, it had been customary for Soviet citizens to travel in groups of 25 to 40 people randomly put together by their trade unions.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Read an interesting article this morning. Apparently the Soviet Union introduced paid time off well before other industrialized countries.</p>
<p>Interestingly, but not unexpectedly, the state determined how and with whom you spent that vacation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As members of a collective, citizens were expected to spend their free time in a manner the government and its leading theorists considered beneficial to society as whole, regardless of an individual’s preferences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since the 1930s, it had been customary for Soviet citizens to travel in groups of 25 to 40 people randomly put together by their trade unions. When adults relaxed at resorts or embarked on tours, their children were sent to summer camps managed by state-run youth groups like the Young Pioneers or the Komsomol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reveals the dedication to the collective rather than the family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soviet vacations served as teambuilding exercises that fostered group cohesion. The closer people got with their family, the further they removed themselves from their neighbors, colleagues, and government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems unthinkable to not be in control of your own vacation to me, born in the West in 1990. Communism, the Soviet Union, and totalitarian regimes, somehow always seem to spark my interest. It is one way of organizing a society, and in some ways it seems like an attractive one. I think it has to do with the sense of purpose that living in such a society might give you. The Collective is most important, and that&rsquo;s what you live for. In theory it is a selfless way of living. But history shows that it has always failed up until now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning this year&rsquo;s vacation at this moment, I&rsquo;ll be returning to my beloved Norway for three weeks in September. And I&rsquo;m so glad that I can decide to go there alone, instead of having to go with a group of 40 strangers.</p>

      <title>The Power of Writing</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/power-of-writing/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/power-of-writing/</guid>
      <description>Ah, writing. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the skills that I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently been praised for throughout my life. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good at it, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s because I enjoy it. It led me to getting an academic degree in English Literature and Culture, simply because I was following the things I was naturally good at.
However, just like any other skill, you can only become better at it through consistent practice. This morning I read a wonderful little blog post on writing regularly, and I was touched by his words:</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, writing. It&rsquo;s one of the skills that I&rsquo;ve consistently been praised for throughout my life. I&rsquo;m pretty good at it, and I think that&rsquo;s because I enjoy it. It led me to getting an academic degree in English Literature and Culture, simply because I was following the things I was naturally good at.</p>
<p>However, just like any other skill, you can only become better at it through consistent practice. This morning I read a wonderful little blog post <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/on-writing-regularly/">on writing regularly</a>, and I was touched by his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, some people believe that the art of writing is a skill that can be summoned on a whim, like a genie emerging from a lamp with a flourish of creative brilliance. In my experience, however, writing is more akin to the labour of a blacksmith, hamming words into shape through the heat and sweat of regular practise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="daily-practice">Daily Practice</h1>
<p>One way to gain more experience is to start keeping a daily journal. I&rsquo;ve always kept some notebook or other, jotting down thoughts and ideas as they came along sporadically. But it was only in July 2020 that I started <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-8-start-a-journal/">to keep a daily journal</a> and writing regularly. I started out writing by hand. I was in at an interesting place in life: I was spending two years in a Buddhist monastery, and after settling down for a couple of months, the intensive meditation practice was releasing all sorts of things in the mind and body, and I started to write them all down. I&rsquo;m still convinced that starting this habit has been one of the most important and beneficial decisions of my life.</p>
<p>It is so simple, but extremely effective. And you don&rsquo;t have to be doing anything special, or be in a special place. Just keeping a daily journal where you note down the things you did that day in a small pocket book is enough to get the habit going. Soon you will find that you will get the urge to write more. After several years of daily journaling, sometimes all I write is &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a pretty good day&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s it for that day. Sometimes I write several pages worth of thoughts, ideas and these longer writings often have powerful effects.</p>
<h1 id="the-power-of-writing">The Power Of Writing</h1>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll be struggling with something, and I&rsquo;ll be at a loss of what to do. The thoughts just keep whirling about aimlessly and no solution to the particular problem at hand seems to emerge from the chaos. Whenever I am in such a situation, I sit down, close my eyes, observe what is going on, and I start to write. I write it all down. The thoughts, the associations that these thoughts generate, and the effects they are having. I write down exactly how I feel. Attaching words to the feelings that I&rsquo;m experiencing mentally and physically. &ldquo;I feel a contraction in my lower abdomen&rdquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m angry, and it manifests as a hot feeling on my forehead&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s when the magic happens: something that I&rsquo;ve come to identify as &ldquo;The Power Of Writing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Somehow the act of writing everything down will create structure in the chaos, and the solution to my problem wil emerge, often from very unexpected angles. Is it the fact that it is structured on paper? Or the fact that the visual representation of the contents of my mind enables me to apply structure to them? Is it the fact that I am moving my hands, adding bodily movement to my cognitive efforts?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the exact answer, but all I know is that it works for me. Almost every time. And often when I don&rsquo;t expect it at all. I&rsquo;ll just be sitting and writing in my journal, writing down a particular challenge that I&rsquo;m facing that day. And somehow some solution appears out of the blue. Whenever this happens, I always smile and write down: &ldquo;The Power of Writing&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="mindfulness">Mindfulness</h1>
<p>Even though I might not know the exact answer, I&rsquo;m certain that it is very closely related to mindfulness. Becoming more mindful through meditation and present moment awareness is the key to happiness in my opnion. I developed a mindfulness practice out of writing by creating this ritual where I sit down and identify what is going on and writing it down. In essence, I&rsquo;m forcing myself to be mindful, and to attach words to my mental and bodily experience. I&rsquo;m getting out of my own way and letting my mind solve the challenge all by itself.</p>
<p>You know what? It&rsquo;s happening right now! The Power of Writing. I hadn&rsquo;t been able to clearly capture in words what the mechanism behind the Power of Writing was, but as I was writing this article, it became obvious to me that it must be mindfulness underlying it all. So I&rsquo;m just going to leave it as it is. This is a perfect example of what you will find in my private zettelkasten. I wrote all of this in one sitting, with minimal editing. Just stream of conciousness, writing it down. And I finished with a wonderful realization.</p>
<p>I feel grateful, satsified and happy. There is also a pleasant tingling at the top of my neck, and an energy rising up through my feet. I hope that this might help someone else one day, and inspire someone to pick up the habit of writing.</p>

Fullstaq specialises in Kubernetes and Cloud Native, so I&amp;rsquo;m really happy I could join their team. I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing projects for a variety of clients, and I think it will be a great place to learn and gain more experience in the Kubernetes and CNCF space.

      <description>As I alluded to in my article about Obsidian, I am very fond of editing my text in neovim. Naturally, if you want to edit in neovim, you need to have your text as local files. I keep all of my personal notes in markdown.
Previously I was using WordPress, but the editing and writing experience became torture which I could not endure any longer. I looked for a different solution that would allow me to edit my files locally instead of in the browser.</description>

<p>As I alluded to in my <a href="/zet/articles/obsidian-introduction">article about Obsidian,</a> I am very fond of editing my text in neovim. Naturally, if you want to edit in neovim, you need to have your text as local files. I keep all of my personal notes in markdown.</p>
<p>Previously I was using WordPress, but the editing and writing experience became torture which I could not endure any longer. I looked for a different solution that would allow me to edit my files locally instead of in the browser.</p>
<p>I discovered <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and I fell in love with it immediately.</p>
<p>Hugo is a static site generator based on markdown files. My entire blog is written in markdown files which are stored <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/blog">in a GitHub repo.</a>. I write my blog posts in vim and when I&rsquo;m done I use Hugo to generate the updated website.</p>
<p>The result is what you see in the &ldquo;public&rdquo; directory in the GitHub repo. This public directory is pushed to a different repo which is hooked up to my hosting provider. My hosting provider uses Plesk, and with Plesk I have the option to connect the GitHub repo to the web server with a webhook. When I push to my hosting repo, the contents are gathered by the webserver and served as public web content.</p>
<p>My complete writing and publishing workflow looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new markdown file</li>
<li>Write the note or article</li>
<li>Save the file and run the &ldquo;hugo&rdquo; command to regenerate the website</li>
<li>Run the &ldquo;publish&rdquo; script. This is a custom script I wrote that takes the contents of the &ldquo;public&rdquo; directory to my hosting repo</li>
<li>Push the newly generated website to the hosting repo</li>
<li>And we&rsquo;re live! 🚀 🎉</li>
</ol>
<p>It is such a smooth and convenient process. I can literally have a new note published to the interet within a few minutes, and it is all done from the command line using my favorite tools.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting a project with a friend. Developing an application. We make a good team, he&amp;rsquo;s great at coding and knows the backend too.
He&amp;rsquo;ll do the development, I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of hosting. We&amp;rsquo;re setting everything up in Azure DevOps, so it is a great way to practice my Azure skills and apply the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in my recently obtained AZ-104 Azure Administrator certification.
Even though it is a small scale hobby project, I still plan to approach it as if it was an enterprise production application.</description>

      <title>Going to Publish Smaller, and More Often</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve transitioned my note taking system towards a Zettelkasten system. I still use directories for folders and make copious links, but more often than not I put them in the larger generic 00-zettelkasten directory in my Obsidian vault.
The concept of &amp;ldquo;atomic notes&amp;rdquo; is also very important in Zettelkasten methods. Notes should be small and concise.
Up until this point I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing full articles on my blog. I came across Rob Muhlestein yesterday and I was very inspired by his setup and public zettelkasten.</description>

      <title>Book Notes: Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life</title>

      <description>I came across this little book while doing some research for my Jiro Dreams of Sushi article. While scanning the book&amp;rsquo;s description, I was intrigued by this sentence: &amp;ldquo;the happiness of always being busy.&amp;rdquo; Although I work hard every day, I also enjoy ticking off the last item on my to-do list and enjoying some rest. Is there more happiness in being in constant activity?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I came across this little book while doing some research for my <a href="/zet/articles/jiro-sushi">Jiro Dreams of Sushi article.</a> While scanning the book&rsquo;s description, I was intrigued by this sentence: &ldquo;the happiness of always being busy.&rdquo; Although I work hard every day, I also enjoy ticking off the last item on my to-do list and enjoying some rest. Is there more happiness in being in constant activity?</p>
<h2 id="ikigai">Ikigai</h2>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Friedrich Nietzsche</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Japanese culture, everybody has a purpose in life: the ikigai. &ldquo;Ikigai is the reason we get up in the morning.&rdquo; The book explores this concept through interesting stories and brings related notions from various areas to explain ikigai to the Western mind.</p>
<p>There are many different ikigai, and people can have several ikigai simultaneously. For example, some people have their vegetable garden as their ikigai, while others have drawing or calligraphy. <a href="/zet/articles/jiro-sushi">Jiro</a> has making sushi as his ikigai. Even though many people have their work as their ikigai, it does not necessarily have to be the case. Ikigai can also be of a social nature, such as a family or local community.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="retirement">Retirement</h2>
<p>When I watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi for the first time, I was surprised that Jiro still worked at his restaurant every day at age 85. This book explores that further.</p>
<p>Apparently, many people never really retire in Japan. The concept of retirement, as we know it in the West, does not exist in the Japanese language: there is &ldquo;no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense of &ldquo;leaving the workforce for good&rdquo; as in English.&rdquo; People continue doing what they like doing as long as their health allows. They keep following their ikigai.</p>
<p>This concept was very refreshing to me and had a profound influence on how I imagine my own future. After becoming more intentional about my career, I became interested in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp">FIRE</a> and the possibility of retiring early. However, as I contemplated this strategy, I discovered that I didn&rsquo;t want to stop working because I really enjoy my work.</p>
<p>Why would I want to retire if I&rsquo;m doing what I love? That was the whole point of switching my career to IT, and this is where Western culture can learn a lot from Japanese culture. In Japanese culture, there is more emphasis on aligning your career with your interests and continuing that passion well into old age.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>When to quit? The job you have worked so hard for? I never once hated my job. I fell in love with my work and gave my life to it. Even though I&rsquo;m 85 years old, I don&rsquo;t feel like retiring.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jiro</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="longevity">Longevity</h2>
<p>A large part of the book is about the residents of Okinawa: the island with the highest number of people 100 years old or older. The authors tell the story of their visit to the island to reveal the secret of the Okinawan&rsquo;s long lives. It is not uncommon to see people working in the fields who are well into their eighties. The Okinawans freely share their secrets with us, and the authors do a great job translating the Japanese principles into actionable advice.</p>
<p>Much of the advice is centered around dietary habits. Not only what to eat, but also how to eat it: &ldquo;Okinawans stop eating when they feel their stomachs reach 80 percent of their capacity, rather than overeating&rdquo;, a practice which is named &ldquo;hara haci bu.&rdquo; They consume a daily average of 1800 to 1900 calories, a significant difference from the 2200 to 3300 calories consumed by an average person in the US every day.</p>
<p>Another theme that keeps returning is the crucial function of social groups for finding meaning in life, especially in old age: &ldquo;It is customary in Okinawa to form close bonds within local communities. A moai is an informal group of people with common interests who look out for one another. For many, serving the community becomes part of their ikigai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This book may be a good resource if you are interested in longevity. Even though I only expected to read about the ikigai concept, it contains a surprisingly large amount of valuable advice and practical tips to live a longer and happier life.</p>
<h2 id="chock-full">Chock-full</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life&rdquo; is a small book that covers an astonishing amount of subjects. It covers topics such as meditation, flow states, and exercise methods such as Tai Chi and Qi Gong. The disadvantage is that it does not deeply cover any of these topics. But I think this book can be a very useful springboard for further research and a great introduction to many different subjects that can improve your life.</p>
<p>It is a short read, but it contains a lot of wisdom, and I learned much from this book. It has changed the way I think of retirement and the way I approach my work. I am also very interested in health and longevity. Through the conversations with the centenarians of Okinawa, I received a lot of helpful tips, which I&rsquo;m already applying to my daily life.</p>
<p>Have I discovered the art of being busy? I believe I took this definition too literally when I started reading this book. I found that Okinawans lead active lives full of meaning but also take plenty of rest. Always being busy does not mean that you have to work yourself to death. However, it does mean that the secret to reaching a healthy old age is to keep doing what you love. There is no need to become sedentary and only sit in front of the TV when you turn 67. I think Western culture has a lot to learn in this area.</p>

      <title>I&#39;m In Love with my Work: Lessons from a Japanese Sushi Master</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/jiro-sushi/</link>

      <description>Last week I watched &amp;ldquo;Jiro Dreams of Sushi&amp;rdquo; again. It must be the eighth time I revisited this piece of art. I have very little interest in sushi, but there is much more to this documentary. It was first recommended to me by my good friend Anders more than five years ago, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t grasp its underlying life lessons the first time around.
Even though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fully understand the message, I was intrigued by it and kept returning to the documentary.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I watched &ldquo;Jiro Dreams of Sushi&rdquo; again. It must be the eighth time I revisited this piece of art. I have very little interest in sushi, but there is much more to this documentary. It was first recommended to me by my good friend Anders more than five years ago, but I couldn&rsquo;t grasp its underlying life lessons the first time around.</p>
<p>Even though I couldn&rsquo;t fully understand the message, I was intrigued by it and kept returning to the documentary. Over the years, I managed to grasp more of its deeper meaning. The documentary is about Jiro: one of the best sushi chefs in the world. His tiny restaurant, located in a subway station, even received a 3 Michelin star rating. So how does a man operating from a subway restaurant become the best in the world? And what can a DevOps Engineer learn from a sushi chef?</p>
<p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://culinaireambiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_J8Bw5e9O9AfmLNdDKRRv6A-1.jpeg" alt="Jiro, the Master"  /></p>
<p>Jiro is referred to as a shokunin, a Japanese cultural phenomenon that doesn&rsquo;t have a direct translation into English. A shokunin is an artisan or a craftsman who has devoted his entire life to becoming a master of his craft. For example, there are shokunin carpenters, weavers, and blacksmiths. The shokunin achieve mastery by doing the same action over and over again and trying to improve with every repetition.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Once you decide on your occupation, you must immerse yourself in your work. You have to fall in love with your work. Never complain about your job. You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill. That&rsquo;s the secret of success and is the key to being regarded honorably.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Jiro</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<p>We get to know Jiro as a man who is devoted to his occupation. He follows the same routine every day; he even gets on the train from the same position. He says he dislikes holidays and prefers to be at work. He used to get up at 5:00 and get home after 22:00. Even at age 85, he&rsquo;s still working at the restaurant every day, simply because he doesn&rsquo;t want to do anything else.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just about putting in long hours and working past the retirement age. It&rsquo;s also about the mindset and the attitude that Jiro has adopted towards his craft:</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen many chefs who are self-critical, but I&rsquo;ve never seen another chef who is so hard on himself. He sets the standard for self-discipline. He&rsquo;s always looking ahead. He&rsquo;s never satisfied with his work. He&rsquo;s always trying to find ways to make the sushi better or to improve his skills. Even now, that&rsquo;s what he thinks about every day.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Masuhiro Yamamoto, Food Critic.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="finding-my-craft">Finding my Craft</h2>
<p>It was hard to decide on my occupation. It took me 32 years and a lot of trial and error to find the answer. I have always envied people who knew they wanted to become a nurse since childhood.</p>
<p>What occupation should I choose? I answered this question by answering another question: what do I like to do in my free time? The answer was clear: I tinkered with computers. I had already coded several websites and loved experimenting with game automation. I ran &ldquo;bot farms&rdquo; on Linux servers which I configured myself from the command line.</p>
<p>I decided to make IT and tech my occupation. Fortunately for me, the job market was in my favor, and employers were much more willing to consider candidates without a formal background in IT. If you&rsquo;d like to read more, I wrote about my journey into DevOps in <a href="/my-journey-into-devops-so-far">this article</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-ways-of-the-shokunin">The Ways of the Shokunin</h2>
<p>After making the career change, I adopted the shokunin mindset and dedicated my life to mastering my craft. In practical terms, I needed to commit to devoting my time to my profession and avoid straying from it. Making this commitment wasn&rsquo;t very difficult because I chose my career based on my free-time activities. It&rsquo;s more about adopting a mindset of striving to make everything relate to each other. For example, I try to select hobby projects that directly relate to what I&rsquo;m working with during the day. This way, my leisure activities will strengthen my professional skills, and my professional expertise will improve my hobby projects, creating a feedback loop that will eventually lead to results.</p>
<p>However, sticking to one thing does not necessarily come naturally to me. I have a tendency to pick up many different hobbies and get very excited about them. First, I will become extremely interested in a particular subject. Then, after approximately three months, I put it aside and become excited about something else. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_object_syndrome">Shiny Object Syndrome</a> because I tend to return to these hobbies in a cyclical pattern. As I apply myself to learning the skill with a feverish intensity, I&rsquo;m able to make a lot of progress during these bouts of obsession. But to the outside world, it might seem like I&rsquo;m constantly changing my mind about what I want.</p>
<p>I always considered this a negative character trait, but over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve learned to embrace it and guide this tendency in the right direction. Because I chose IT as my occupation and DevOps as an area of specialization, I gave myself a broad scope of interest with many sub-skills to learn. If you look at the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops">DevOps Roadmap</a>, you&rsquo;ll see that a good DevOps Engineer must master many different skills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve given myself a large playground with a fence around it, full of exciting things to learn. I can go down a Python rabbit hole for a few months and improve my coding skills. Later, I find myself sucked into <a href="https://mischavandenburg.com/linux-creativity/">builing my own OS</a> and learning more about Linux in the process. The fence around the playground isn&rsquo;t locked, but I do my best to stay inside the fence. When, for example, I start getting the urge to get back into music production again, I consider that it will take up a few hours a day to get back on track. Investing these hours into something that brings me joy, but is also related to my occupation, would be a better option. Reflecting in this way keeps me focused on my goals.</p>
<p>My website is another example of this fusion between professional and free-time activities. I love to write. It&rsquo;s a relaxing activity, even though it is very challenging sometimes. After I learn about a new subject, I try to write about it. This is the best way I know to verify whether I&rsquo;ve really understood the topic. When I sit down to write about something, I force myself to think clearly about it and to make sure everything aligns properly in my mind. When I cannot explain the concepts in a few clear sentences, I know I don&rsquo;t fully understand it yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can&rsquo;t exist without the other.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>William Zinsser, On Writing Well</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way my blog supports my professional development is because I prefer to write my blog posts in neovim in the markdown format. Writing and editing text often involves moving a lot of words and paragraphs around. Because I use vim to do my writing, I&rsquo;m also constantly practicing the keybinds I use for writing and editing code during my day job. I often learn a new motion for my blog writing, which I use the next day at work.</p>
<h2 id="never-finished">Never Finished</h2>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;All I want to do is make better sushi. I do the same thing over and over, improving bit by bit. There is always a yearning to achieve more. I&rsquo;ll continue to climb, trying to reach the top, but no one knows where the top is. Even at my age, after decades of work, I don&rsquo;t think I have achieved perfection. But I feel ecstatic all day. I love making sushi. That&rsquo;s the spirit of the shokunin.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Jiro</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<p>Jiro taught me never to be satisfied with my skills. If I desire to become a master of my craft, there will never be a point where I can lean back and think that I&rsquo;ve learned enough. There&rsquo;s always something to improve, which is why I chose an IT career. My thirst for learning cannot be quenched, and there&rsquo;s always something to learn in this field.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="devotion">Devotion</h2>
<p>Although it might seem like a simple food documentary, do not be deceived. Jiro Dreams of Sushi is full of valuable life lessons. It&rsquo;s one of the documentaries which I revisit regularly. It&rsquo;s relaxing to watch, and I get hugely inspired by Jiro&rsquo;s devotion to his craft and powerful teachings every time.</p>
<p>Jiro&rsquo;s guidance has changed my life. He made me realize that if I wished to become a master of my craft, I needed to devote my life to it. I changed my lifestyle, so the things I do in my free time strengthen my professional skills. I also became more mindful of the content I consume and the things I read, trying to keep it related to my occupation. He showed me the true meaning of the phrase &ldquo;my work is my hobby.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Always look beyond and above yourself. Always try to improve on yourself. Always strive to elevate your craft. That&rsquo;s what he taught me.&rdquo;</p>

      <title>Building my Own OS: Linux as a Creative Activity</title>

      <description>NOTE: In this article, I use a rather broad definition of “Operating System.” I do not intend to appear as if I wrote and compiled my own Linux kernel, nor do I understand the inner workings of the kernel written in C. Instead, with “building my OS from scratch,” I intend to convey that I used a minimal Linux distribution as a starting point and started building from there.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>NOTE: In this article, I use a rather broad definition of “Operating System.” I do not intend to appear as if I wrote and compiled my own Linux kernel, nor do I understand the inner workings of the kernel written in C. Instead, with “building my OS from scratch,” I intend to convey that I used a minimal Linux distribution as a starting point and started building from there.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">introduction</h2>
<p>I started using GNU/Linux as a daily driver about six months ago, and I have not regretted the decision ever since. There has not been a single use case where I needed to use Windows for anything at all.</p>
<p>As I was getting more used to daily driving Linux, I noticed how much I enjoyed the ability to customize my operating system and workflow. Finally, after spending a weekend going down the customization rabbit hole, I had a good-looking terminal and customized neovim to perform as I needed it.</p>
<p>Not much later, I came across Arch Linux and the idea of building your own operating system from the ground up. I was instantly intrigued and knew I wanted to do the same. A few months have passed since I first came across Arch Linux, and now I am writing this blog post in neovim on my custom OS that I created from scratch. The font, the spacing, the colors, everything is exactly how I like it, and I love using it.</p>
<p>When you first install Arch Linux, all you get is a black screen with a blinking cursor. However, the experience of creating a fully functional graphical environment from “nothing” has been extremely satisfying, and I learned so much about GNU/Linux in the process. I also realized that this could be seen as a creative activity, like a painter creating his masterpiece from a blank canvas or a sculptor carefully chipping away at a block of marble.</p>
<h2 id="not-just-graphics">not just graphics</h2>
<p>When I say customization, I am not just referring to the visual aspects of the operating system. The things going on “under the hood” must also be carefully configured when you use a minimal distro such as Arch Linux.</p>
<p>Arch Linux comes with very few packages preinstalled, and every time you wish to add something to your system, you need to install it and enable the service in systemd. For example, after I did the installation and created my user account, I needed to run a command with root privileges. To my great surprise, even the “sudo” command was unavailable and needed to be installed.</p>
<p>This is the aspect I learned most from. Whenever I desired a certain functionality from my operating system, I needed to install and enable it. This has given me a much better understanding of the processes and daemons running on my system. It has also given me a greater appreciation of all the elements needed to provide a working environment.</p>
<h2 id="graphic-violence">graphic violence</h2>
<p>When you create an Arch Linux installation USB and boot it up, you are greeted with a command line and nothing else.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/creative1.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>When you install something more beginner-friendly, such as Ubuntu or Manjaro KDE, your installation will include a graphical desktop environment. But on Arch Linux, you must install and configure this yourself. Furthermore, to be able to render a graphical environment, you will also need to install and configure a display server such as Xorg.</p>
<p>When I started on my journey, I intended to create something that used minimal resources with a minimal look. Having used GNOME on Manjaro for a few months, I was very satisfied, but I wanted to try a tiling window manager to shave down even more resource usage. After some research, I ended up with the Awesome Window Manager. Here are some screenshots of the final result:</p>

<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english">The Cambridge Dictionary</a> defines creativity as “the ability to produce original and unusual ideas, or <strong>to make something new or imaginative</strong>.”</p>
<p>When you embark on a journey, such as creating your operating system, you will probably start with a particular intention or a goal that you will work towards. With this goal in mind, you can start searching for the tools and color schemes you need to create the system that you have in mind. The result is a unique combination of tools, colors, fonts, and programs specifically tailored to your needs and wants and chosen by you.</p>
<p>Is this any different from a painter starting with a blank canvas or a musician starting with a fragment of a melody, ending up with a complete symphony? Entering commands into a computer terminal might not strike everybody as a creative activity. Still, I have found that it is a very effective and satisfying way of expressing myself and creating something I love to use daily. As an IT professional, I spend most of my time behind my computer. Doesn’t it make sense to put effort into building something customized to your needs?</p>

      <description>I always struggled with finding an online nickname for myself. I was never given one, and over the years I used a few here and there, ranging from Nordic gods to my favourite fantasy character: Gandalf the Grey.
I intended to create a tech blog to document my journey ever since I started my career change. But for months I was stopped by trying to decide on a name. (That’s me in a nutshell), because it needed to be perfect.</description>

<p>I intended to create a tech blog to document my journey ever since I started my career change. But for months I was stopped by trying to decide on a name. (That’s me in a nutshell), because it needed to be perfect. Eventually I decided to just use my full name.</p>
<p>Although I have zero connections with Russia, neither genetically nor culturally, my parents decided to give me a name of Russian origin: Mischa.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://babynames.com/name/mischa">this website</a>, Mischa has the following meaning:</p>
<p>“The name Mischa is primarily a gender-neutral name of Russian origin that means <em>Who Is Like God</em>“</p>
<p>Although I admire my parents for giving me such an ambitious name, I must confess that I turned out to be of a much more earthy and less godly nature.</p>
<p>When I was younger, an old gymnastics teacher once told me that Mischa meant “bear” in Russian, and I always liked that connotation much more. I also turned out to be more bear-like than god-like, being 190cm tall and having thick and bristly curly hair.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-Misha-mean-Its-Russian-by-the-way">this post on Quora</a> confirms that my name indeed has the meaning of bear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;In Russia Mishka sometimes also used to denote a bear, particularly a bear cub.&rdquo;</em>
<a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Misha-Sivan">Misha Sivan</a>, Born in USSR.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although I am conveniently ignoring the “cub” part of his explanation, I thought it was pretty cool that my actual name had connotations with our ursine friends.</p>
<p>Moreover, I lived 9 years in Norway where I roamed the mountains for weeks at a time, just me and my tent and a fishing rod. I developed a very close connection with nature during those years. Not only its beauty, but also its merciless forces and awe-inspiring ingenuity.</p>
<p>Although I never encountered a bear myself, they are most definitely present in the Norwegian nature. One time the newspapers told me that there was a bear sighted 4 kilometers from where I was camping one weekend.</p>
<p>But this is what the bear represents to me: the time I was allowed to spend in the North and the resulting connection with nature. The solitary character of the male, calmly roaming for many miles in search of sustenance. A force to be reckoned with when aggravated, but in general preferring to stay at a distance.</p>
