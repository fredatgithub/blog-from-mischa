      <description>It was a nice week. I had an extra day off on Asenscion day and I decided to go for a camping trip for the first time after I moved back to the Netherlands.
It was a great experience, and I wrote a couple of Tumblr posts with photos:

      <title>I Ran 10k For The First Time Today</title>

      <description>I ran 10k for the first time in my life today.
I ran to the beach and back in Heemskerk on hardened forest roads, listening to the birds and feeling the spring sun on my face. I felt great and had a smile on my face most of the time. Lots of interesting thoughts popping up in the mind as I run and reflect. Hardly noticed that 77 minutes went by because I was having such a good time.</description>

      <title>Started Using Tumblr for Travel Blogging</title>

      <description>With the spring finally being fully released on the Netherlands, my wanderlust has awakened again after lying dormant for two years. In my 9 years in Norway I became a seasoned outdoorsman spending much time roaming the mountains and forests and always spending days or weeks out in the wild with my tent.
When I moved back to the Netherlands this has been put on hold for a couple of years while I focused on changing my career on IT.</description>

In my 9 years in Norway I became a seasoned outdoorsman spending much time roaming the mountains and forests and always spending days or weeks out in the wild with my tent.</p>
<p>When I moved back to the Netherlands this has been put on hold for a couple of years while I focused on changing my career on IT. Now that the career is rolling along nicely by the looks of it, I&rsquo;m super excited to start exploring the Netherlands and see what the outdoors life is like in an area where the nature is significantly less wild and abundant.</p>
<p>I needed a solution to post pictures quickly and easily because I want to start logging my trips as well. My hugo setup is great for text and techincal content but I need something where I can easily post straight from my phone and Tumblr seems like the best option. I&rsquo;ll also be posting more on Instagram from here on out.</p>
<p>Here is my first post:</p>
