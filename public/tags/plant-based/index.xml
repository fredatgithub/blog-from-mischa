      <description>A super inspiring podcast with Mike Fremont who ran marathons well into his nineties on a plant-based diet and who raced the National Canoe Championships at age 99. He adopted a plant based diet after being diagnosed with colon cancer at age 69. Although the cancer had metastasized and spread to other parts of his body, he received an operation and the cancer was cured. He only became competitive in running when he was well into his eighties.</description>

<p>A super inspiring podcast with Mike Fremont who ran marathons well into his nineties on a plant-based diet and who raced the National Canoe Championships at age 99. He adopted a plant based diet after being diagnosed with colon cancer at age 69. Although the cancer had metastasized and spread to other parts of his body, he received an operation and the cancer was cured. He only became competitive in running when he was well into his eighties.</p>
<p>I find his story hugely inspiring and motivating to keep focussing on my health, never make any compromises on my diet and to keep running.</p>
<p>When asked about the most important things in life, he said that helping other people in any way you can is the only thing that brings real rewards and satisfaction. It&rsquo;s not the money.</p>
