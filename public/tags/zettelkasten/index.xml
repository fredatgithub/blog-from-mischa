      <title>Azure DevOps Personal Access Tokens are always for authenticating into ADO</title>

      <description>The PAT (Personal Access Token) often comes up during practice tests for the AZ-400.
One way to remember when to use a PAT is that these are only for authenticating into Azure DevOps, never to external services.
For example, you might get a question on connecting your Azure DevOps project with a GitHub account from Azure DevOps, and PAT will show up as one of the alternative answers. By remembering that PATs are only for authenticating into ADO, you can elminate this alternative, and make your choice easier.</description>

<p>Personal Access Tokens are an alternative to passwords but should be treated in exactly the same way.</p>

      <title>Using parameter expansion as search and replace</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/slash-syntax-replace/</link>

      <description>Last modified: 2023-01-10
In this evening&amp;rsquo;s studies I came across this bash script in a tutorial by Rob Muhlenstein:
!#/bin/bash echo -e ${PATH//:/\\n} I could not make heads or tails of all these slashes and curly braces, since the output clearly indicated that search and replacement was being performed. I&amp;rsquo;m used to the sed / vim syntax: s/foo/bar
After some research I learned that &amp;lsquo;//&amp;rsquo; is a global search and replace syntax of several text processing programs.</description>

<p>In this evening&rsquo;s studies I came across this bash script in a tutorial by Rob Muhlenstein:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">!#/bin/bash
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> -e <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="p">//:/</span><span class="se">\\</span><span class="nv">n</span><span class="si">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I could not make heads or tails of all these slashes and curly braces, since the output clearly indicated that search and replacement was being performed. I&rsquo;m used to the sed / vim syntax: <code>s/foo/bar</code></p>
<p>After some research I learned that &lsquo;//&rsquo; is a global search and replace syntax of several text processing programs. It is known as parameter expansion in bash.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&#34;1234567890&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="p">//[0-9]/x</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This replaces all the digits in the $foo variable with &lsquo;x&rsquo;, so the output would be xxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>To do this with sed, you would do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="nv">$foo</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span> <span class="p">|</span> sed <span class="s1">&#39;s/[0-9]/x/g&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For more info:</p>
<p><code>man bash</code></p>
<p><code>/parameter expansion</code></p>

      <title>Automatically adding my recent blog posts to my GitHub Readme</title>

      <description>My friend gave me a nice tip for customizing the readme on my personal GitHub page. I discovered there is a whole world of plugins and customizations out there.
I set up this one for my GitHub homepage. It uses a workflow to update the readme in my personal GitHub repo with the most recent posts from this blog, based on the RSS feed. Neat!
It was very easy to set up.</description>

      <title>Fall in love with sed.</title>

      <description>Sed, it&amp;rsquo;s so powerful. I remember I struggled with finding practical uses for it when I did my LPIC-1 certification. But now I find myself using it several times a week. It is so powerful to edit multiple files at a time. I use it for work, but also for making changes to my entire second brain in Obsidian with one command.
Today I needed to update my /articles/ links to /zet/articles/ links because I&amp;rsquo;m restructuring my website.</description>

      <title>Application Insights: Telemetry Sampling</title>

      <description>Telemetry is the collection of measurements or other data at remote points, and transmitting that data to a receiver for monitoring.
Sampling is used to reduce telemetry traffic and costs for storage and data in Application Insights.
For small and medium sized applications sampling is generally not necessary.
Advantages of sampling:
Throttling data when the application suddenly sends a high volume of telemetry in a short time This saves costs! Keeping a pricing tier quota Reduce network traffic from telemetry collection Three different kinds of sampling:</description>

<p>Advantages of sampling:</p>

<p>Three different kinds of sampling:</p>

<li>from ASP.NET or Azure Functions</li>
<li>only for these two</li>

      <title>Pipelines: Continuous Monitoring</title>

      <description>This term can be confusing. Initially I thought it meant monitoring of the pipelines themselves. However, in the context of Azure Release Pipelines, continuous monitoring refers to something else.
Continuous monitoring leverages metrics from other services such as Application Insights. You can set up release gates based on these metrics. For example, you can set up a release gate to roll back the deployment if an alert is being fired for high CPU usage in the application.</description>

      <title>Distributed Tracing</title>

      <description>Debugging is done using call stacks in monolithic applications. Nowadays it is more common to deploy an application using a microservices architecture. Microservices make it easier to update certain parts of the application, and allow for more frequent deployments.
Using microservices does have a disadvantage: you cannot use the local call stack for debugging, because calls are sent to different microservices.
Distributed tracing is an implementation of the call stack in the cloud.</description>

      <title>What is a SDK?</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/sdk/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/sdk/</guid>
      <description>A software development kit (SDK) is a set of tools provided by the manufacturer of (usually) a hardware platform, operating system (OS), or programming language.
SDKs contain all the tools you need to get started. They typically contain a compiler, a debugger and an API. But they can also contain documentation and testing tools.</description>

      <description>When you call a function, the system sets aside space in memory for the function to do its work. Those chunks are called &amp;ldquo;stack frames&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;function frames.&amp;rdquo;
These frames are arranged in a stack. The frame for the most recently called function is always at the top of the stack. When a new function is called, it becomes the active frame, and it is on top of the stack.</description>

<p>The function that is actually doing something at the moment is on top of the stack and is known as the &ldquo;active frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the function finishes its work, the frame is popped off of the stack. The frame in second place becomes the active frame. It had been paused in the meantime, and now it is active again, because it is on top.</p>
<p>Functions that are not on top, are not running.</p>

      <title>Going to Publish Smaller, and More Often</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve transitioned my note taking system towards a Zettelkasten system. I still use directories for folders and make copious links, but more often than not I put them in the larger generic 00-zettelkasten directory in my Obsidian vault.
The concept of &amp;ldquo;atomic notes&amp;rdquo; is also very important in Zettelkasten methods. Notes should be small and concise.
Up until this point I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing full articles on my blog. I came across Rob Muhlestein yesterday and I was very inspired by his setup and public zettelkasten.</description>
