      <title>Trying out pandoc for vim</title>

      <description>I do all of my writing in markdown. I keep my diaries in my Second Brain, I constantly write notes on the topics I&amp;rsquo;m studying, and my entire blog is written in markdown.
Some of the writing is done in Obsidian but I&amp;rsquo;m moving away from Obsidian step by step. I&amp;rsquo;ll still keep my second brain compatible with it, but I want to be able to do all of my writing in (neo)vim.</description>

<p>Some of the writing is done in Obsidian but I&rsquo;m moving away from Obsidian step by step. I&rsquo;ll still keep my second brain compatible with it, but I want to be able to do all of my writing in (neo)vim.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using nvim-markdown for a while now and I was quite happy with it, but it was bothering me that <strong>bold text</strong> was not rendered in my editor.</p>
<p>Pandoc had been on my radar for a while because it uses the Commonmark <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/">markdown spec</a> and it can be used to convert to many different documentation types. It&rsquo;s an interesting thought to keep my entire collection of notes and writings compatible with something that can be converted into anything.</p>
<p>I noticed rwxrob uses pandoc as one of his few vim plugins.</p>
<p>It took me an hour to make it compatible with neovim and to disable the spelling and folding. I couldn&rsquo;t just set the provided variables because they are still in vimscript and I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to set them yet because they use a hashtag in their name #</p>
<p>So far I like it, but there are a few things that I miss from my nvim-markdown</p>
<ul>
<li>automatic bulleted list</li>
<li>nested bulleted lists
<ul>
<li>with nvim-markdown these lists would continue</li>
<li>Here I have to indent each line myself and add a bullet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>navigation between headers
<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t use this much to be honest, but I haven&rsquo;t figured it out in pandoc yet. Maybe it is possible?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I find myself using bullete lists and nested lists a lot in my notes, but I wonder if it is better to step away from those and make more use of markdown headings.</p>

      <title>How to Surround a Word with Quotes in Vim</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/surround-word-quotes-neovim/</link>

      <description>[[neovim]]
I find myself quoting words very often in vim when I&amp;rsquo;m writing bash code. I used to do this by simply navigating around the word and typing them, but I knew there had to be a better way.
I found this vim command:
ciw&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt;P
&amp;ldquo;c&amp;rdquo; deletes into register and enters insert mode. &amp;ldquo;iw&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;inner word&amp;rdquo; and selects the word.
So we delete the entire word and enter insert mode.</description>

<p>&ldquo;c&rdquo; deletes into register and enters insert mode. &ldquo;iw&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;inner word&rdquo; and selects the word.</p>
<p>So we delete the entire word and enter insert mode. Then we type two quotes, and we press &ldquo;P&rdquo; to paste the register (containing the word) before the cursor.</p>
<p>Voila, the word is surrounded by quotes.</p>
<p>To make it even easier, I added this to my keymaps, and I&rsquo;ll add a few more for parentheses and brackets.</p>
<p><code>vim.keymap.set(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;&lt;leader&gt;wsq&quot;, 'ciw&quot;&quot;&lt;Esc&gt;P', { desc = &quot;Word Surround Quotes&quot; })</code></p>

      <title>What is the difference between a Go module and a package?</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/package-module-go/</link>

      <description>A module is generally associated with a single git repo.
You can have a module with multiple packages, and each package would get its own subdirectory.
You should always name your main file main.go
creating a module Use the go mod init {{your path here}} command to initiate a module.
multiple modules I was running into some trouble with this because I want to have one big repo where I will store all my go projects.</description>

<p>I was running into some trouble with this because I want to have one big repo where I will store all my go projects.</p>
<p>My gopls LSP in Neovim would start throwing errors when I added multiple projects in my repo.</p>
<p>The fix is to create a separate directory for each project. For example:</p>
<p>/go/hello/main.go</p>
<p>/go/hi/main.go</p>
<p>Hello and Hi are each separate projects.</p>
<p>Now I enter each of these directories and run <code>go mod init hello</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this isn&rsquo;t good practice for production code, but it serves its purpose to collect all my learning code in one place.</p>

      <title>Had a CLI Shokunin Moment Today</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/cli-shokunin-moment/</link>

      <description>Today was meal-prepping day and I cut up some vegetables for the coming week. I’m on a strict caloric restriction regimen and need to meticulously track and plan all the food that I consume.
I cut up three kinds of vegetables and wrote down how many grams of each I cut up so I could divide them by three and add them to my calorie tracking application.
As I took out my phone to pick up my calculator to divide each number, my inner engineer started complaining about the fact that I had to do three calculations and that it would be much better to loop over an array of these values.</description>

<p>I cut up three kinds of vegetables and wrote down how many grams of each I cut up so I could divide them by three and add them to my calorie tracking application.</p>
<p>As I took out my phone to pick up my calculator to divide each number, my inner engineer started complaining about the fact that I had to do three calculations and that it would be much better to loop over an array of these values.</p>
<p>I had my laptop nearby with a terminal open and wrote this instead:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">for</span> i in <span class="m">287</span> <span class="m">252</span> 321<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="nv">$i</span><span class="s2"> / 3&#34;</span> <span class="p">|</span> bc<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">done</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="m">107</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After turning my passion into my career, I love the fact that I’m starting to think like an engineer in all my other areas of life. I’m also happy to see my progress in command line work. I chose to go the hard way, using bash instead of zsh and doing all my editing in vim and using Linux as much as possible, and it is paying off because I don’t have to think much about these little operations anymore.</p>
<p>Then again, I would be much better off training my brain to become better at doing math without the aid of paper or calculators 🤓</p>

      <title>How to continuously run a Go file while coding in the terminal</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/running-go-on-change/</link>

      <description>I do all my coding and note taking in the terminal using tmux and neovim. I picked up a nice trick from Rob Muhlenstein today.
You can use this command in a split window to keep running a Go file. It will update when you save the file.
entr -c bash -c &amp;quot;go run main.go&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; main.go
Entr runs commands when files change. Here we are feeding it only one file, but you can also feed it a directory like so:</description>

<p>Entr runs commands when files change. Here we are feeding it only one file, but you can also feed it a directory like so:</p>
<p><code>find src/ | entr -s 'make'</code></p>
<p>Super handy to see the outcome of your code changes in real time.</p>
<p>To run all the files in the directory, use the following:</p>
<p><code>entr -c bash -c &quot;go run . &quot; &lt; &lt;(find .)</code></p>
<p>I picked this up while going through Rob&rsquo;s Beginner Boost of 2022:</p>

      <description>Deploying to subscriptions and management groups To tell Bicep which scope to deploy to, use the targetScope keyword, for example, managementGroup.
You&amp;rsquo;re not specifying which management group exactly, this is done during deployment of the template file.
targetScope can be set to resourceGroup, subscription, managementGroup or tenant.
If it is not set, Bicep assumes resourceGroup.
create a resource group targetScope = &amp;#39;subscription&amp;#39; resource resourceGroup &amp;#39;Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups@2021-01-01&amp;#39; = { name: &amp;#39;example-resource-group&amp;#39; location: &amp;#39;westus&amp;#39; } To deploy you use az deployment group create for resource groups, but you use az deployment sub create for subscriptions, mg for management group and tenant for tenant.</description>

<p>deploymentScripts resources are either PowerShell or Bash scripts that run in a Docker container as part of your template deployment. The default container images have either the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell available. These scripts run during the processing of the ARM template, so you can add custom behavior to the deployment process.</p>

<p>You will lose any comments and whitespace.</p>
<p>Bicep modules are intended to be combined into larger deployments. Template specs are for sets of resources with a certain configuration.</p>
<p>Template specs can be used as a Bicep module. You use the following code to import it:</p>

      <description>The past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out a few options to run Docker containers and a Kubernetes clusters on my new MacBook Pro M2.
Unfortunately you can&amp;rsquo;t just run brew install docker and expect it to work. Additionally, Docker desktop requires that you purchase a license if you use it for work purposes.
Minikube works fine as well, but the networking driver for qemu is not fully supported yet, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried any of the other alternatives because I found something better.</description>

<p>Unfortunately you can&rsquo;t just run <code>brew install docker</code> and expect it to work. Additionally, Docker desktop requires that you purchase a license if you use it for work purposes.</p>
<p>Minikube works fine as well, but the networking driver for qemu is not fully supported yet, and I haven&rsquo;t tried any of the other alternatives because I found something better.</p>
<p>Rancher Desktop provides everything that you need. It sets up a local VM where it will run a Kubernetes cluster using k3s. It will configure the containerd container engine for you which you can interact with using <code>nerdctl</code>.</p>
<p>To install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew install rancher
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">#after installing rancher, start it up and wait for it to boot the VM.</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">alias</span> <span class="nv">docker</span><span class="o">=</span>nerdctl
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">docker run hello-world
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And you&rsquo;re good to go. Rancher will add the rancher-desktop to your kube context.</p>
<p>To test your Kubernetes cluster:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">k get pods
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">k get nodes

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Or visit localhost:31066 in your browser. Replace 31066 with the port you found listed under your services.</p>

      <title>Notes: Intermediate Bicep</title>

      <description>Today I finished the Intermediate Bicep module. Here are my notes.
Child and Extension You can also use Bicep to refer to resources that were created outside the Bicep file itself. For example, you can refer to resources that your colleagues have created manually by using the Azure portal, or from within another Bicep template or module, even if they&amp;rsquo;re in a different resource group or subscription. By using these features of Bicep, you can unlock the ability to create powerful templates that deploy all aspects of your Azure infrastructure.</description>

<h1 id="child-and-extension">Child and Extension</h1>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Some resources are only deployed in context of their parent. For example:</p>
<p>Virtual network subnets 	Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets
App Service configuration 	Microsoft.Web/sites/config
SQL databases 	Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases
Virtual machine extensions 	Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions
Storage blob containers 	Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers
Azure Cosmos DB containers</p>
<p>It does not make sense for a container to exist without a storage account.</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-child-and-extension">Difference between child and extension</h2>
<p>In summary, you define extensions with the <code>scope</code> keyword, and child resources are defined by nesting them or by using the <code>parent</code> keyword.</p>
<p>An extension resource is a resource that modifies another resource. For example, assigning a role to a resource.</p>
<p>A child resource is a resource that exists only within the context of another resource, such as a subnet existing only within a vnet.</p>

<p>Extension resources are always attached to other Azure resources. They extend them with extra functionality. Some examples are role assignments, locks, and policy assignments.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to deploy a lock by itself. It always has to be deployed to another resource, because it prevents deletion or modification of a resource.</p>
<p>Resources are defined almost the same way as normal resources, but you add the <code>scope</code> property to tell Bicep that it is attached to another resource in the template.</p>

<h1 id="hello-world-in-go">Hello World in Go</h1>
<p>We start by writing a Hello World and studying all the elements.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">package</span> <span class="nx">main</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="s">&#34;fmt&#34;</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="how-do-we-run-code">How do we run code?</h3>
<p><code>go run main.go</code> runs the program
<code>go build main.go</code> compiles it to an executable</p>
<h3 id="what-does-package-main-mean">What does package main mean?</h3>
<p><code>package main</code></p>
<p>A package is a collection of common source code files.</p>
<p>One app is a package. If you have multiple files in a folder, such as helper.go or support.go, they should have <code>package main</code> to indicate that they belong to package main.</p>
<p>*Why do we call it main?</p>
<p>There are two types of packages.</p>
<ul>
<li>executable
<ul>
<li>generates file that can be run</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reusable
<ul>
<li>used as &ldquo;helpers&rdquo;</li>
<li>reusable logic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you call the package <code>main</code>, you are telling the compiler it needs to be compiled as an executable. If it  has a different name, it won&rsquo;t generate an executable. Main is sacred.</p>
<p>Any other name is a reusable or dependency type package (helper code).</p>
<p>Another important point is that whenever you create an executable package, it must always have a func called &lsquo;main&rsquo;.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-import-fmt-mean">What does import fmt mean?</h3>
<p>The import statement is used to give our package access to code written in another package.  You are saying &ldquo;give access to all code in fmt&rdquo;. Fmt is a standard library package included in Go. Short for format. Used to print out information to the terminal.</p>
<p>Other packages included in the standard library of go are debug, math, encoding, crypto, io.</p>
<p>golang.org/pkg for documentation on standard library packages for Go.</p>
<p>A lot of learning go is learning the standard packages and how they work.</p>
<h3 id="organizing-the-maingo-file">Organizing the main.go file</h3>
<p>It is the same for every go file, just like the code example at the top of the page. Package main, import fmt, and func main.</p>
<h1 id="variable-declarations">variable declarations</h1>
<p><code>var card string = &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;</code></p>
<p>var: we are about to create a new variable</p>
<p>card: name</p>
<p>string = telling the go compiler that only strings will be assigned to this variable</p>
<h3 id="alternatively">Alternatively:</h3>
<p><code>card := &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;</code></p>
<p>Here you are relying on the compiler to figure out what type it is.</p>
<p>Compiler will infer the type.</p>
<p>We only use this := assignment for <strong>new variables</strong></p>
<p>If you want to assign a value to a variable after it is declared, you just do <code>card = &quot;Five of Diamonds&quot;</code></p>
<h3 id="go-types">Go types</h3>
<p>Go is  a statically typed language.</p>
<p>Javascript, python are dynamically typed language. We don&rsquo;t care what value is assigned to a variable.</p>
<p>You always a assign a type to a variable in Go.</p>
<p>Basic go types:</p>
<ul>
<li>bool</li>
<li>string</li>
<li>into</li>
<li>float64 : a number with a decimal after it.</li>
</ul>

      <title>I started to learn Go!</title>

      <description>For month&amp;rsquo;s I considered to learn Go, and today I finally started.
I doubted for a long time, because I figured it would be better to dive deeper into Python. However, when I reflected on it, I realized I&amp;rsquo;m able to do the things I want to do in Python. I can create scripts to manipulate data, and I can string different tools and libraries together if I need to. So how deep do I actually need to go as a DevOps Engineer?</description>

<p>I doubted for a long time, because I figured it would be better to dive deeper into Python. However, when I reflected on it, I realized I&rsquo;m able to do the things I want to do in Python. I can create scripts to manipulate data, and I can string different tools and libraries together if I need to. So how deep do I actually need to go as a DevOps Engineer?</p>
<p>The breakthrough came when I discovered this website: <a href="https://goodfirstissue.dev/language/go">Good First Issue</a>. It&rsquo;s a collection of issues in open source projects which are suitable for people who are starting out. Scrolling through the available projects for Python and Go, I noticed I got a lot more energy from the things I saw in the Go list: Grafana, ArgoCD, Kubernetes. I probably have a long way to go before I can make any meaningful contributions, but my goal is to be able to contribute to open source in the future.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&rsquo;m going to focus my career in the direction of Kubernetes and CNCF, where Go is mostly used.</p>
<p>I have a week off before I start my new job so I&rsquo;m going to spend a few hours a day to get a good start, and when I&rsquo;m working full time again, my plan is to spend at least one pomodoro (25 minutes) a day on Go. Small increments will add up to something big over time.</p>
<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/go">a new GitHub repo</a> where I&rsquo;ll be uploading all my practice code and projects.</p>

      <title>Controlling Apple Music with hotkeys from anywhere on MacOS</title>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/apple-music-hotkeys/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a little obsessed with controlling everything with my keyboard. That&amp;rsquo;s why I loved AwesomeWM so much on my Arch Linux setup, I hardly used my mouse anymore.
One thing I loved about my setup was the ability to control my music from the keyboard from anywhere. This is a feature I picked up from the awesome-copycats theme for AwesomeWM. This was one of the first things I missed when I made my switch to MacOS.</description>

<p>I started using Apple Music as my music app but it does not have any global hotkeys, and it makes you use a widget with the mouse.</p>

      <description>My new employer kindly sponsored me with a new 16-inch MacBook Pro M2. I chose 32GB Ram and the base model with 12 CPU and 19 GPU cores and 1TB of hard disk. These specifications will suit my needs well.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been daily driving Linux for a year now, and it has been such an incredible journey. Building my own Arch Linux system taught me much about Linux and what it means to maintain a system yourself.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My new employer kindly sponsored me with a new 16-inch MacBook Pro M2. I chose 32GB Ram and the base model with 12 CPU and 19 GPU cores and 1TB of hard disk. These specifications will suit my needs well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been daily driving Linux for a year now, and it has been such an incredible journey. Building my own Arch Linux system taught me much about Linux and what it means to maintain a system yourself. I will undoubtedly miss my custom AwesomeWM configuration and the freedom that Arch provides.</p>
<p>Technically I could have chosen a Windows laptop and installed Linux on it. But I went for a Mac for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility. I&rsquo;ll be doing contracts for various customers, so I&rsquo;ll likely run into environments where I&rsquo;ll need to use some software, such as a VPN that is not supported on Linux. MacOS will always be compatible everywhere.</li>
<li>Portability. I&rsquo;ll probably be going to the office multiple times a week, and using a MacBook as a daily driver will allow me to take my full setup with me everywhere. I also plan to spend some time abroad, and using a MacBook as a daily driver will allow me to work remotely for extended periods.</li>
<li>Stability. Even though my Linux systems never really broke on me, there is always a possibility. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that with MacOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;ll be switching to my MacBook as my primary workstation, I will continue using Linux for my hobby projects and home lab. So there will be plenty of opportunity to keep growing in that area in the future.</p>

      <description>Last week I accepted a job offer! I&amp;rsquo;ve been hired as a DevOps Engineer by Fullstaq.
Fullstaq specialises in Kubernetes and Cloud Native, so I&amp;rsquo;m really happy I could join their team. I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing projects for a variety of clients, and I think it will be a great place to learn and gain more experience in the Kubernetes and CNCF space.
Fullstaq has been delightfully welcoming and great to work with so far.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago someone gave me a tip. Oracle actually has a really good free tier offering.
You can host a 4CPU 24GB VM for free!
This is perfect for a lab environment.
I spent my evening creating the VM and setting up a kubernetes cluster from scratch.
Use this video to claim your free vm:

      <title>Setting up automated backups on my Arch Linux system with rsync and bash</title>

      <description>For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been stuyding every hour of free time that I had. Now that I reached my certification goals for now, I finally had some time to do a chore I had been meaning to do for a long time.
My Arch Linux system is fully encrypted, and I make backups. But I was still doing it a bit haphazardly, usually every Friday.
I wanted to automate this for a long time now, but I never got round to it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months I&rsquo;ve been stuyding every hour of free time that I had. Now that I reached my certification goals for now, I finally had some time to do a chore I had been meaning to do for a long time.</p>
<p>My Arch Linux system is fully encrypted, and I make backups. But I was still doing it a bit haphazardly, usually every Friday.</p>
<p>I wanted to automate this for a long time now, but I never got round to it. Today I made the first steps, but it is still in progress.</p>
<p>Naturally, I could use a tool like Timeshift or something similar to schedule my backups. However, I want to do it myself using rsync because I want to fully understand what I am backing up, when, and where. Rsync is also used in our environment at work, so I assume it is more common in enterprise and production environments.</p>
<h2 id="full-system-backup">full system backup</h2>
<p>Before I was making a full system backup every Friday using this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">sudo rsync -aAXH --info<span class="o">=</span>stats1,progress2 --exclude<span class="o">={</span><span class="s2">&#34;/dev/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/proc/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/sys/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/tmp/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/run/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/mnt/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/media/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/lost+found&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/home/*/.cache/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/data-hdd/&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/games/&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/var/lib/docker/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/home/mischa/music/*&#34;</span>,<span class="s2">&#34;/swapfile&#34;</span>, <span class="s2">&#34;/data-hdd2/&#34;</span>, <span class="s2">&#34;/data-hdd3/&#34;</span><span class="o">}</span> / /data-hdd/backups/arch-beast/01-01-23
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command creates a full backup of my entire root filesystem, and it should be possible to restore my entire system by just reversing the target and destination in the end.</p>
<p>However, as I was coming up with my new strategy, I thought this was overkill.</p>
<h2 id="slimming-down">slimming down</h2>
<p>All I really need to back up is my home directory and it would be nice to have my /etc directory backed up as well.</p>
<p>So I wrote a simple shell script to do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="cp">#!/bin/bash
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="cp"></span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># rsync -a --delete --quiet /path/to/backup /location/of/backup</span>

<p>I have a few scripts running in cronjobs on my system. I have a goal of putting them all in systemd timers, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten round to it yet. For now, I will just add my backup scripts to my existing cronjobs setup.</p>
<p>To make my backups every day, I added this to my crontab:</p>
<p><code>0 12 * * * /bin/bash /home/mischa/git/lab/bash/backup</code></p>
<p>Every day it will make a backup to the same directory and update the changed files, or delete the files I deleted from my system.</p>
<p>I also wanted to have a weekly backup happening on Monday.</p>
<p>I will make a more elaborate script to make a weekly directory, and rotate it with a new directory every week. But for now, I just chose a quick solution by creating a weekly version of my script and running it every Monday.</p>
<p>The only difference is the path:</p>
<p><code>BACKUPS_DESTINATION=&quot;/data-hdd/backups/arch-beast/weekly&quot;</code></p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m typing this 30 minutes after I passed my AZ-400 exam. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in a lovely cafe on Leidseplein in Amsterdam and feel relieved. Another significant certification bites the dust. This one took about 70 hours of study.
I started preparing immediately after passing my AZ-104 exam, which was a good move. The AZ-400 requires you to know many details about Azure services and how to access them. For example, Shared Access Signatures are only used for accessing storage accounts, but they came up quite often as alternative answers to the questions.</description>

For example, Shared Access Signatures are only used for accessing storage accounts, but they came up quite often as alternative answers to the questions.</p>
<p>The exam itself was difficult, but the AZ-104 was harder. The AZ-104 exam was more challenging because the questions were complicated and required you to simultaneously balance many different factors in the mind. The AZ-400 was difficult because the answer alternatives that are provided are incredibly similar to each other, and they make you very insecure about what the right choice might be. As a result, I changed my answers many times.</p>
<p>I will do another study guide for this certification soon and publish my notes and Anki deck too. Now it&rsquo;s time to celebrate and relax a little.</p>

      <title>Azure DevOps Personal Access Tokens are always for authenticating into ADO</title>

      <description>The PAT (Personal Access Token) often comes up during practice tests for the AZ-400.
One way to remember when to use a PAT is that these are only for authenticating into Azure DevOps, never to external services.
For example, you might get a question on connecting your Azure DevOps project with a GitHub account from Azure DevOps, and PAT will show up as one of the alternative answers. By remembering that PATs are only for authenticating into ADO, you can elminate this alternative, and make your choice easier.</description>

      <title>The Pomodoro technique has won me over</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/pomodoro/</link>

      <description>I did a lot of studying last year, and I achieved a few tough certifications. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been good at studying and never struggled with getting decent grades in university. As a result, I never felt the need to use particular techniques to pass my tests. However, now that I need to do my studies combined with a full-time job, I did some optimization and looked into study techniques.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I did a lot of studying last year, and I achieved a few tough certifications. I&rsquo;ve always been good at studying and never struggled with getting decent grades in university. As a result, I never felt the need to use particular techniques to pass my tests. However, now that I need to do my studies combined with a full-time job, I did some optimization and looked into study techniques.</p>
<p>One technique I&rsquo;ve become very fond of is the Pomodoro Technique. I don&rsquo;t have any problems focusing for long periods, but I still decided to try it. I use the standard 25-minute study with a 5-minute break routine, and after four cycles, I take a 30-minute break.</p>
<p>The Pomodoro technique has been a way to force myself to take breaks, which I wasn&rsquo;t used to. I used to chip away at a specific task for hours. However, I discovered that when I take a break, walk around for five minutes, and apply myself to the task again, my mind is in a fresh state and much more receptive to the information. Perhaps the time I spend studying after a break is actually more productive because the mind had a little rest.</p>
<p>The technique also pushed my limits a bit more. I study more hours a day, considering that I also work full time. There is this moment where I want to quit studying, but I ask myself, &ldquo;do I have another Pomodoro in me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve gotten used to breaking things up into 25-minute chunks of time, I started using the Pomodoro technique for other areas in life as well, such as blog writing or coding projects.</p>
<p>You can use any tool you like to start using the Pomodoro technique and pick any break schedule that suits you. I&rsquo;ll link some resources below. All you need is some sort of timer. You can use a timer on your computer or a physical timer. I use the Forest app on my iPhone because it integrates with the iOs &ldquo;do not disturb&rdquo; and &ldquo;focus&rdquo; modes, so  I don&rsquo;t get any distracting notifications when I&rsquo;m on a Pomodoro.</p>

In this evening&amp;rsquo;s studies I came across this bash script in a tutorial by Rob Muhlenstein:
!#/bin/bash echo -e ${PATH//:/\\n} I could not make heads or tails of all these slashes and curly braces, since the output clearly indicated that search and replacement was being performed. I&amp;rsquo;m used to the sed / vim syntax: s/foo/bar
After some research I learned that &amp;lsquo;//&amp;rsquo; is a global search and replace syntax of several text processing programs.</description>

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">!#/bin/bash
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> -e <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="p">//:/</span><span class="se">\\</span><span class="nv">n</span><span class="si">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I could not make heads or tails of all these slashes and curly braces, since the output clearly indicated that search and replacement was being performed. I&rsquo;m used to the sed / vim syntax: <code>s/foo/bar</code></p>
<p>After some research I learned that &lsquo;//&rsquo; is a global search and replace syntax of several text processing programs. It is known as parameter expansion in bash.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&#34;1234567890&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">foo</span><span class="p">//[0-9]/x</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This replaces all the digits in the $foo variable with &lsquo;x&rsquo;, so the output would be xxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>To do this with sed, you would do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="nv">$foo</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span> <span class="p">|</span> sed <span class="s1">&#39;s/[0-9]/x/g&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For more info:</p>
<p><code>man bash</code></p>
<p><code>/parameter expansion</code></p>

      <description>Sed, it&amp;rsquo;s so powerful. I remember I struggled with finding practical uses for it when I did my LPIC-1 certification. But now I find myself using it several times a week. It is so powerful to edit multiple files at a time. I use it for work, but also for making changes to my entire second brain in Obsidian with one command.
Today I needed to update my /articles/ links to /zet/articles/ links because I&amp;rsquo;m restructuring my website.</description>

      <description>Telemetry is the collection of measurements or other data at remote points, and transmitting that data to a receiver for monitoring.
Sampling is used to reduce telemetry traffic and costs for storage and data in Application Insights.
For small and medium sized applications sampling is generally not necessary.
Advantages of sampling:
Throttling data when the application suddenly sends a high volume of telemetry in a short time This saves costs! Keeping a pricing tier quota Reduce network traffic from telemetry collection Three different kinds of sampling:</description>

      <description>This term can be confusing. Initially I thought it meant monitoring of the pipelines themselves. However, in the context of Azure Release Pipelines, continuous monitoring refers to something else.
Continuous monitoring leverages metrics from other services such as Application Insights. You can set up release gates based on these metrics. For example, you can set up a release gate to roll back the deployment if an alert is being fired for high CPU usage in the application.</description>

      <description>Debugging is done using call stacks in monolithic applications. Nowadays it is more common to deploy an application using a microservices architecture. Microservices make it easier to update certain parts of the application, and allow for more frequent deployments.
Using microservices does have a disadvantage: you cannot use the local call stack for debugging, because calls are sent to different microservices.
Distributed tracing is an implementation of the call stack in the cloud.</description>

These frames are arranged in a stack. The frame for the most recently called function is always at the top of the stack. When a new function is called, it becomes the active frame, and it is on top of the stack.</description>

<p>These frames are arranged in a stack. The frame for the most recently called function is always at the top of the stack. When a new function is called, it becomes the active frame, and it is on top of the stack.</p>
<p>The function that is actually doing something at the moment is on top of the stack and is known as the &ldquo;active frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the function finishes its work, the frame is popped off of the stack. The frame in second place becomes the active frame. It had been paused in the meantime, and now it is active again, because it is on top.</p>
<p>Functions that are not on top, are not running.</p>

      <title>Going to Publish Smaller, and More Often</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve transitioned my note taking system towards a Zettelkasten system. I still use directories for folders and make copious links, but more often than not I put them in the larger generic 00-zettelkasten directory in my Obsidian vault.
The concept of &amp;ldquo;atomic notes&amp;rdquo; is also very important in Zettelkasten methods. Notes should be small and concise.
Up until this point I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing full articles on my blog. I came across Rob Muhlestein yesterday and I was very inspired by his setup and public zettelkasten.</description>

I came across <a href="https://github.com/rwxrob">Rob Muhlestein</a> yesterday and I was very inspired by his setup and public zettelkasten. I think I&rsquo;ll move to a similar approach. Still planning to write and publish full articles as well, but also including atomic notes and personal status updates.</p>
