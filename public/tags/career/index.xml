      <title>Decided to split up into a technical and personal blog after all</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with this ever since I started blogging 2 years ago (can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s already been that long). But I&amp;rsquo;ve finally made the decision: I&amp;rsquo;m keeping this blog at mischavandenburg.com as a tech and career focused blog where I share technical knowledge and notes, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new personal blog at mischavandenburg.blog.
I have fallen in love with blogging. Documenting my own life in writing has become a very therapeutic and valuable experience to me.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling with this ever since I started blogging 2 years ago (can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s already been that long). But I&rsquo;ve finally made the decision: I&rsquo;m keeping this blog at mischavandenburg.com as a tech and career focused blog where I share technical knowledge and notes, and I&rsquo;m starting a new personal blog at <a href="https://mischavandenburg.blog">mischavandenburg.blog</a>.</p>
<p>I have fallen in love with blogging. Documenting my own life in writing has become a very therapeutic and valuable experience to me. Even if nobody reads what I put out into the world, it is incredibly satisfying to scroll through your own blog and go back in time to see what I was learning or doing or feeling at that time.</p>
<p>Blogging is an expression of creativity to me. My fingers move on the keyboard and an article appears. I&rsquo;m creating text. I&rsquo;m not a visual person, unfortunately. I don&rsquo;t see images when I think and I&rsquo;m rather bad at drawing or arranging things in a pleasing way. Throughout my life I have expressed my creativity in music, but I consciously haven&rsquo;t engaged in making music in the past few years because it takes up so much time in practice. But I have found a very rewarding way of expressing myself in writing by blogging.</p>
<p>However, I feel that I am constraining myself on this blog because it is is linked to my LinkedIn account and I keep posting to LinkedIn from here. Even though I have nothing to hide, I&rsquo;m pouring my thoughts out on the internet after all, I do feel that LinkedIn is best kept as a professional platform where people can expect consistency and a focus on technical topics, even when they navigate away from there to my own blog.</p>
<p>But I have so much more to give. I want to write about topics that deeply interest me: meditation, Buddhism, running, plant-based diet, healthy living, longevity, mental health, addiction. I feel the urge to pour out these thoughts freely in a place I can call my home on the web, without feeling any restraint or concern. That&rsquo;s why I gave my new blog the headline <strong>&ldquo;A place where I can truly be free&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>Another reason why I&rsquo;m splitting it off is because I intend to use this blog in the process of becoming a Microsoft MVP. The achievement of that goal was not in my mind when I started blogging about personal topics on this blog, but now I think it will be best to keep this blog clean and technical in order to present a clear image in the MVP approval process.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about SEO or ads or the amount of views this blog gets. It&rsquo;s not about SEO optimization or having to have a niche. I&rsquo;m more concerned with giving any readers a good experience as possible.</p>
<p>So here we go. This blog has a (re)new(ed) technical focus, and I&rsquo;m going to keep sharing my notes, learnings, AKS and Azure updates and other discoveries I make along the way. But I&rsquo;ll also be migrating away the personal posts on running, weeknotes and other posts away from this blog.</p>
<p>If you are interested in my personal ramblings though, make sure to check out my new personal blog here:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sound investing is not complicated.&rdquo; - location: 204 ^ref-4205</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This book was recommended to me multiple times on the DutchFIRE Reddit. I finally got round to reading it.</p>
<h1 id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h1>
<ul>
<li>Save half your income</li>
<li>After building an emergency fund, invest your savings</li>
<li>Invest everything in broadly spread index funds</li>
<li>The market always goes up (in the long run)</li>
<li>The market is going to crash, you need to prepare to ride it out</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not about retiring early, it&rsquo;s about F-you money</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1>
<p>From my research I had already thought out a pretty similar investment strategy of maximizing savings and putting it all in index funds. I don&rsquo;t have a very entrepreneurial or business oriented mind. I don&rsquo;t have the interest to dive deep into financial reports and analyzing company earnings. So as an average guy I&rsquo;ll just invest it into index funds. Keep adding as much as I can to them for 20 years, let the market and compounding interest do the work, and then I should be financially independent.</p>
<p>What is financial independence? This book frames it as F-you money:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For me, the pursuit of financial independence has never been about retirement. I like working and I’ve enjoyed my career. It’s been about having options. It’s been about being able to say “no.” It’s been about having F-You Money and the freedom it provides.&rdquo; - location: 228 ^ref-34594</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this idea, because I&rsquo;m not necessarily interested in retiring very early. I love my work and I&rsquo;m lucky to work in a field that is under continuous development. It&rsquo;s already hard to keep up, so the thought of working 30 years from now is actually rather exciting. I think it&rsquo;s good to have something to do, it&rsquo;s not healthy to just travel around when you&rsquo;re 35 and I think it will become a very empty and unfulfilling life pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d much rather have the freedom to take a few months off here and there. Mini retirements. Go travelling for 6 months and start an exciting new position somewhere, or continue working on the things you left off.</p>
<h1 id="quotes">Quotes</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Since money is the single most powerful tool we have for navigating this complex world we’ve created, understanding it is critical. If you choose to master it, money becomes a wonderful servant. If you don’t, it will surely master you.&rdquo; - location: 183 ^ref-59928</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The beauty of a high savings rate is twofold: You learn to live on less even as you have more to invest.&rdquo; - location: 207 ^ref-14488</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The other thing I quickly figured out is that financial independence is at least as much about being able to live modestly as it is about cash, as our opening parable describes.&rdquo; - location: 242 ^ref-10147</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you decide to pursue financial freedom you are going to have to choose to spend your money on investments. Somehow in our culture this has come to be seen by most people as deprivation. That has never made much sense to me. Personally, there is nothing I’d rather buy or own than F-You Money.&rdquo; - location: 2897 ^ref-10616</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It’s not hard. Stop thinking about what your money can buy. Start thinking about what your money can earn. And then think about what the money it earns can earn. Once you begin to do this, you’ll start to see that when you spend money, not only is that money gone forever, the money it might have earned is gone as well. And so on.&rdquo; - location: 595 ^ref-24245</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The market always goes up. Always. Bet no one’s told you that before. But it’s true. Understand this is not to say it is a smooth ride. It’s not. It is most often a wild and rocky road. But it always, and I mean always, goes up. Not every year. Not every month. Not every week and certainly not every day. But take a moment and look again at the chart of the stock market in the last chapter. The trend is relentlessly, through disaster after disaster, up.&rdquo; - location: 822 ^ref-50566</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is why you have to toughen up, learn to ignore the noise and ride out the storm; adding still more money to your investments as you go. 7. To be strong enough to stay the course you need to know these bad things are coming—not only intellectually but on an emotional level as well. You need to know this deep in your gut. They will happen. They will hurt. But like blizzards in winter they should never be a surprise. And, unless you panic, they won’t matter.&rdquo; - location: 830 ^ref-55872</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We believe we can pick individual stocks. You can’t pick winning stocks. Don’t feel bad. I can’t either. Nor can the overwhelming majority of professionals in the business. The fact that this ability is so rare is the key reason why the very few who apparently can are so famous.&rdquo; - location: 935 ^ref-53690</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To consider buying a house, if you are so inclined. But don’t be in a hurry. Houses are not investments, they are expensive indulgences. Buy one only when you can easily afford it and if it provides the lifestyle change you want.&rdquo; - location: 2836 ^ref-13073</p>

      <title>Choosing A Cloud And The Importance Of Specialization</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/choosing-a-cloud-provider-and-specialization/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/choosing-a-cloud-provider-and-specialization/</guid>
      <description>As a DevOps Engineer or Cloud Native Engineer, I think it’s important to specialize in one cloud provider in the beginning of your career. Specializing allows you to gain deep knowledge and expertise in the specific tools and services related to that cloud provider, making you a valuable asset to any company using that provider. Although cloud computing is similar in essence no matter which provider you choose, each cloud provider has its own vocabulary and way of structuring things.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a DevOps Engineer or Cloud Native Engineer, I think it’s important to specialize in one cloud provider in the beginning of your career. Specializing allows you to gain deep knowledge and expertise in the specific tools and services related to that cloud provider, making you a valuable asset to any company using that provider. Although cloud computing is similar in essence no matter which provider you choose, each cloud provider has its own vocabulary and way of structuring things.</p>
<p>After my first year as a DevOps Engineer I was still trying to figure out which one to choose and which one would suit me best. With the rapid pace of innovation in the cloud computing industry, it can be challenging to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and features for multiple providers. I tried to keep up with the developments for each provider and tried to be a broad professional who could work with all of them. However, I think it is best to specialize early in your career, and then you can learn a different one after you have gained some significant experience with your first one.</p>
<p>After several insightful conversations with my colleagues, and after working with Azure for a year as a consultant, I decided to go all-in on Azure, and it has been a liberating experience so far. By focusing solely on Azure, I am able to fully immerse myself in their ecosystem and gain a deep understanding of their tools and services. I feel I have a sense of direction now, and I can limit the content I consume and the news I read to this one particular ecosystem only. And that feels like a relief to me.</p>
<p>This is of course very personal for everybody, but I’m someone who loves to learn and who tends to be a bit of a “jack of all trades” who knows a little bit of everything but who doesn’t have very deep knowledge of a particular subject in particular. By choosing a cloud and going all-in on it, I can become a specialist and go deep in Azure.</p>
<h1 id="why-i-chose-azure">Why I chose Azure</h1>
<p>I chose Azure because Microsoft is already very established in the Dutch market. Governments and large corporations typically have their entire user base stored in Active Directory and they use Microsoft Office licenses already. When they decide to move to the cloud, Microsoft offers them very good terms if they choose Microsoft instead of AWS, for example.</p>
<p>Azure’s strong presence in the Dutch market and their ability to offer attractive terms to existing Microsoft customers make them a popular choice for companies looking to move to the cloud. With 73 percent, Microsoft Azure took most of the market share for cloud computing in the Netherlands in 2020. Azure had within the healthcare sector the highest share with 90 percent. Microsoft has some very substantial clients within government, health care, and the corporate world.</p>
<p>These previous reasons are all related with job security and the assurance that there will be a long career in Azure ahead of me. But it&rsquo;s not only because of these reasons why I chose Azure. After gaining experience with Azure as a consultant, I&rsquo;ve discovered that the cloud ecosystem Microsoft has created suits me very well. I&rsquo;m very impressed with the different solutions that Azure is able to provide to solve business needs. Not every business is interested or capable of running everything on virtual machines, and Azure&rsquo;s PAAS and SAAS offerings provide level of of abstraction which can be tailored to any business out there.</p>
<p>Moreover, I really like the tooling. Although I really wanted to gain more experience with Terraform when I started my current contract, I&rsquo;ve fallen a little bit in love with Bicep after I started to work with it every day. I love the fact that Bicep uses Azure itself as a state file, rather than having to manage a state file which can be a pain when using it from pipelines or with multiple people. The Bicep language server (which can be used in Neovim as well) is a very pleasant editing experience. Azure DevOps really nailed it with being a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; for everything from project management and tickets to CI/CD with Azure Pipelines. Although it has its quirks, Azure DevOps is a real pleasure to work with. And I also think that the Azure CLI is a very well-designed interface to the cloud platform.</p>
<h1 id="beyond-blue">Beyond Blue</h1>
<p>After I made my choice, I decided to join Beyond Blue. I was already working for Fullstaq, and Beyond Blue is a sister company of Fullstaq. Beyond Blue is a team of Azure Experts who love to go deep and who have a huge amount of experience and knowledge on Microsoft Azure. We help start-ups, scale-ups, and enterprises in both the public and private sector create scalable, flexible, and secure cloud-native solutions build on Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>We have Microsoft Valued Professionals (MVP), Microsoft Certified Trainers (MCT), Azure Kubernetes Service and containerization experts on board who are ready to tackle each and every challenge for our clients.</p>
<h1 id="summing-up">Summing up</h1>
<p>To sum up, I think specializing early has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limits the amount of news and new developments you have to follow</li>
<li>Allows learning terminology quicker becuase you stay within one ecosystem</li>
<li>Certifications tend to build upon each other within a single provider</li>
<li>Gives a sense of direction in learning and development</li>
<li>Improves familiarity with the documentation and tooling</li>
</ul>
<p>You can always broaden your horizon after you have gained a few years with the first provider you chose, if you&rsquo;d like to.</p>

      <title>The Ups And Downs Of A Devops Engineer</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/ups-and-downs-of-devops-engineer/</link>

      <description>Next winter I&amp;rsquo;ll be entering my third year as a DevOps Engineer. When you first break into this field there is an overwhelming amount of things to learn. Frankly, this will always be the case. But I&amp;rsquo;m reaching a point where I have gained experience with most of the main areas and tooling, and I can start seeing the relations between them and how they compare to one another.
Just like any other job or activity, there are things that you like and that suit you well, and there are things that you don&amp;rsquo;t like.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next winter I&rsquo;ll be entering my third year as a DevOps Engineer. When you first break into this field there is an overwhelming amount of things to learn. Frankly, this will always be the case. But I&rsquo;m reaching a point where I have gained experience with most of the main areas and tooling, and I can start seeing the relations between them and how they compare to one another.</p>
<p>Just like any other job or activity, there are things that you like and that suit you well, and there are things that you don&rsquo;t like. And now the first phases of overwhelm are confidently behind me, I&rsquo;m starting to learn the things I prefer doing over others.</p>
<p>Being a DevOps Engineer does not mean you get to write code all day. I&rsquo;m currently working in an organization where we&rsquo;re not working fully DevOps yet. Rather than deploying many times in small increments, we are still using patching windows. Managing infrastructure in this way means you&rsquo;ll need to communicate with teams to schedule the patching and submit changes to the approval board. It can involve a lot of emailing and talking back and forth. And sometimes things go wrong and everything needs to be rescheduled again. Although it is valuable experience, and I certainly have the communication skills to handle these kinds of situations, I&rsquo;m learning that I lean more towards the dev side of things.</p>
<p>Today was a fun day at work. I&rsquo;ve been working on a PR for a while whenever I wasn&rsquo;t required to work on tickets. The PR involved refactoring a Bicep template for our Azure Key Vault deployments, which were using parameter files with a lot of repeated code. After getting a lot of good feedback on my code changes, and submitting it for review multiple times, it was finally approved and I could get to work.</p>
<p>I used bash, jq and vim to clean up the parameter files for each workload and submitted PRs. My colleague, who helped me with the PR&rsquo;s, was standing by and ready to approve them as soon as I submitted them. Some pipelines ran into some trouble and required a few more PR&rsquo;s to fix, and there was a bit of pressure because we needed to get the pipelines working before any other changes needed to be deployed the next day.</p>
<p>By working together like this we managed to clean up 2850 lines of code in one day and it was a great feeling to get this job done. I had been working on this for a couple of weeks and it&rsquo;s so satisfying to move that ticket status to &ldquo;done&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the coding! And I really enjoy working with Infrastructure as Code! Somehow it really gives me a lot of pleasure knowing that the code I&rsquo;m writing will be transformed to running infrastructure after it is submitted. I love writing programs in my free time as well, but there is just something magical seeing your parameter file being turned into a functional Kubernetes cluster or Key Vault.</p>
<p>Working as a DevOps Engineer, I&rsquo;m generally having so much fun. I really enjoyed myself when I was learning jq and used scripts to change hundreds of lines of code at a time and submitting them as a PR. And some days, the work is less enjoyable, but it is all part of the job. It all serves to deliver value to the end customer, and if I can have fun most of the time while delivering value, I know I&rsquo;m in the right place.</p>
<p>In any case, there hasn&rsquo;t been a second during these past two years where I regretted my choice of becoming a DevOps Engineer. I love my job, I found my passion in my work, and I&rsquo;m so excited for the future. Cloud computing is never standing still, Kubernetes is starting to become more and more popular, and my skills grow with every day that passes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy camper.</p>

      <title>Podcast Notes: Dopamine and Motivation - Huberman</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/dopamine-and-motivation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/dopamine-and-motivation/</guid>
      <description>Dopamine Listened to an interesting podcast on Dopamine by Andrew Huberman. I always enjoy his content because he is completely driven by science, not by personal opinion. He is truly objective as far as I can tell.
Dopamine is often misunderstood. It is not necessarily associated with good feelings after you pursue an activity. It is more related to motivation to engage in certain behaviours.
Rewards Scientists did an experiment where they observed children of kindergarten age, and later reproduced this in adults.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="dopamine">Dopamine</h1>
<p>Listened to <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/leverage-dopamine-to-overcome-procrastination-and-optimize-effort/">an interesting podcast on Dopamine</a> by Andrew Huberman. I always enjoy his content because he is completely driven by science, not by personal opinion. He is truly objective as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Dopamine is often misunderstood. It is not necessarily associated with good feelings after you pursue an activity. It is more related to motivation to engage in certain behaviours.</p>
<h1 id="rewards">Rewards</h1>
<p>Scientists did an experiment where they observed children of kindergarten age, and later reproduced this in adults. The children were monitored during school days, where they had blocks of structured time and free time. During structured time their activities were managed. They had to sing or write, for example. Then they had blocks of free time where they could do whatever activity they liked.</p>
<p>They observed what activity the children liked to do in their free time, and then started to reward these children for their work. For example, if the children liked to draw in their free time, the researches started giving them gold stars and other praise for their work.</p>
<p>Then the researches removed the reward for the activity, and interestingly, the children and adults started showing less interest and enjoyment in the activity because they were lacking the reward.Note that this is the activity that they liked to do in their free time prior to the experiment.</p>
<p>This all has to do with the nature of dopamine, dopamine baselines and peaks.</p>
<p>Huberman explains this with a metaphor of a pool. In the pool you have waves, and the waves have peaks and troughs. At the peaks, your dopamine is high, but they are inevitably followed by troughs: dips in dopamine, which lead to low energy and low motivation.</p>
<p>Then there is the baseline of dopamine: the amount of water in the pool. The baseline is the relative point to which the peaks and throughs are determined.</p>
<p>So it is important that you don&rsquo;t reward yourself for activities that you are doing. Don&rsquo;t reward yourself too much when you achieve a fitness or study goal. You will feel good after the event, but you will end up in a through. Being in the trough means feeling demotivated, leading to procrastination.</p>
<h1 id="getting-out-of-the-trough">Getting Out Of The Trough</h1>
<p>The good news is that the system will reset itself after experiencing highs or lows due to rewards.Getting out of the trough happens automatically, but you can influence the rate at which you climb out of it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are not motivated to study. You&rsquo;ll need to do something which is more painful. Something that&rsquo;s even harder to do. Whatever feels harder to do in the moment than the activity that you <em>should</em> be doing. Do something that makes you feel uncomfortable.</p>
<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>
<ul>
<li>exercise for 1 minute</li>
<li>do something that really sucks
<ul>
<li>cold water</li>
<li>anything that makes you cringe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>leverage something that&rsquo;s painful</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-holy-grail-of-motivation">The Holy Grail Of Motivation</h1>
<p>The holy grail of motivation: not needing any external reward, but enjoying the activity itself that is leading you towards your goal. For example, enjoying running training in pursuit of a marathon goal. Enjoying coding and doing coding exercises in pursuit of becoming a software engineer.</p>
<p>I feel very fortunate that I succeeded at turning my passion into my career. The journey itself is fun. I enjoy coding, and that activity is taking me closer towards the goal of becoming a good software engineer and the ability to contribute to open source.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m typing this 30 minutes after I passed my AZ-400 exam. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in a lovely cafe on Leidseplein in Amsterdam and feel relieved. Another significant certification bites the dust. This one took about 70 hours of study.
I started preparing immediately after passing my AZ-104 exam, which was a good move. The AZ-400 requires you to know many details about Azure services and how to access them. For example, Shared Access Signatures are only used for accessing storage accounts, but they came up quite often as alternative answers to the questions.</description>

For example, Shared Access Signatures are only used for accessing storage accounts, but they came up quite often as alternative answers to the questions.</p>
<p>The exam itself was difficult, but the AZ-104 was harder. The AZ-104 exam was more challenging because the questions were complicated and required you to simultaneously balance many different factors in the mind. The AZ-400 was difficult because the answer alternatives that are provided are incredibly similar to each other, and they make you very insecure about what the right choice might be. As a result, I changed my answers many times.</p>
<p>I will do another study guide for this certification soon and publish my notes and Anki deck too. Now it&rsquo;s time to celebrate and relax a little.</p>

      <title>Book Notes: Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/ikigai-book/</link>

      <description>I came across this little book while doing some research for my Jiro Dreams of Sushi article. While scanning the book&amp;rsquo;s description, I was intrigued by this sentence: &amp;ldquo;the happiness of always being busy.&amp;rdquo; Although I work hard every day, I also enjoy ticking off the last item on my to-do list and enjoying some rest. Is there more happiness in being in constant activity?
Ikigai &amp;ldquo;He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I came across this little book while doing some research for my <a href="/zet/articles/jiro-sushi">Jiro Dreams of Sushi article.</a> While scanning the book&rsquo;s description, I was intrigued by this sentence: &ldquo;the happiness of always being busy.&rdquo; Although I work hard every day, I also enjoy ticking off the last item on my to-do list and enjoying some rest. Is there more happiness in being in constant activity?</p>
<h2 id="ikigai">Ikigai</h2>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Friedrich Nietzsche</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Japanese culture, everybody has a purpose in life: the ikigai. &ldquo;Ikigai is the reason we get up in the morning.&rdquo; The book explores this concept through interesting stories and brings related notions from various areas to explain ikigai to the Western mind.</p>
<p>There are many different ikigai, and people can have several ikigai simultaneously. For example, some people have their vegetable garden as their ikigai, while others have drawing or calligraphy. <a href="/zet/articles/jiro-sushi">Jiro</a> has making sushi as his ikigai. Even though many people have their work as their ikigai, it does not necessarily have to be the case. Ikigai can also be of a social nature, such as a family or local community.</p>
<p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F3nw94z2pgadc432nw33p8qg5-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F01%2Fwhat-is-ikigai-darling.png&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=f5fa9a17a2865d283af2bfdf8d978f1dcb0e9ff4e7fb646fb2c26c4963f95e77&amp;ipo=images" alt=""  /></p>
<h2 id="retirement">Retirement</h2>
<p>When I watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi for the first time, I was surprised that Jiro still worked at his restaurant every day at age 85. This book explores that further.</p>
<p>Apparently, many people never really retire in Japan. The concept of retirement, as we know it in the West, does not exist in the Japanese language: there is &ldquo;no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense of &ldquo;leaving the workforce for good&rdquo; as in English.&rdquo; People continue doing what they like doing as long as their health allows. They keep following their ikigai.</p>
<p>This concept was very refreshing to me and had a profound influence on how I imagine my own future. After becoming more intentional about my career, I became interested in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp">FIRE</a> and the possibility of retiring early. However, as I contemplated this strategy, I discovered that I didn&rsquo;t want to stop working because I really enjoy my work.</p>
<p>Why would I want to retire if I&rsquo;m doing what I love? That was the whole point of switching my career to IT, and this is where Western culture can learn a lot from Japanese culture. In Japanese culture, there is more emphasis on aligning your career with your interests and continuing that passion well into old age.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>When to quit? The job you have worked so hard for? I never once hated my job. I fell in love with my work and gave my life to it. Even though I&rsquo;m 85 years old, I don&rsquo;t feel like retiring.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jiro</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="longevity">Longevity</h2>
<p>A large part of the book is about the residents of Okinawa: the island with the highest number of people 100 years old or older. The authors tell the story of their visit to the island to reveal the secret of the Okinawan&rsquo;s long lives. It is not uncommon to see people working in the fields who are well into their eighties. The Okinawans freely share their secrets with us, and the authors do a great job translating the Japanese principles into actionable advice.</p>
<p>Much of the advice is centered around dietary habits. Not only what to eat, but also how to eat it: &ldquo;Okinawans stop eating when they feel their stomachs reach 80 percent of their capacity, rather than overeating&rdquo;, a practice which is named &ldquo;hara haci bu.&rdquo; They consume a daily average of 1800 to 1900 calories, a significant difference from the 2200 to 3300 calories consumed by an average person in the US every day.</p>
<p>Another theme that keeps returning is the crucial function of social groups for finding meaning in life, especially in old age: &ldquo;It is customary in Okinawa to form close bonds within local communities. A moai is an informal group of people with common interests who look out for one another. For many, serving the community becomes part of their ikigai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This book may be a good resource if you are interested in longevity. Even though I only expected to read about the ikigai concept, it contains a surprisingly large amount of valuable advice and practical tips to live a longer and happier life.</p>
<h2 id="chock-full">Chock-full</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life&rdquo; is a small book that covers an astonishing amount of subjects. It covers topics such as meditation, flow states, and exercise methods such as Tai Chi and Qi Gong. The disadvantage is that it does not deeply cover any of these topics. But I think this book can be a very useful springboard for further research and a great introduction to many different subjects that can improve your life.</p>
<p>It is a short read, but it contains a lot of wisdom, and I learned much from this book. It has changed the way I think of retirement and the way I approach my work. I am also very interested in health and longevity. Through the conversations with the centenarians of Okinawa, I received a lot of helpful tips, which I&rsquo;m already applying to my daily life.</p>
<p>Have I discovered the art of being busy? I believe I took this definition too literally when I started reading this book. I found that Okinawans lead active lives full of meaning but also take plenty of rest. Always being busy does not mean that you have to work yourself to death. However, it does mean that the secret to reaching a healthy old age is to keep doing what you love. There is no need to become sedentary and only sit in front of the TV when you turn 67. I think Western culture has a lot to learn in this area.</p>

      <title>I&#39;m In Love with my Work: Lessons from a Japanese Sushi Master</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/jiro-sushi/</link>

      <description>Last week I watched &amp;ldquo;Jiro Dreams of Sushi&amp;rdquo; again. It must be the eighth time I revisited this piece of art. I have very little interest in sushi, but there is much more to this documentary. It was first recommended to me by my good friend Anders more than five years ago, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t grasp its underlying life lessons the first time around.
Even though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fully understand the message, I was intrigued by it and kept returning to the documentary.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I watched &ldquo;Jiro Dreams of Sushi&rdquo; again. It must be the eighth time I revisited this piece of art. I have very little interest in sushi, but there is much more to this documentary. It was first recommended to me by my good friend Anders more than five years ago, but I couldn&rsquo;t grasp its underlying life lessons the first time around.</p>
<p>Even though I couldn&rsquo;t fully understand the message, I was intrigued by it and kept returning to the documentary. Over the years, I managed to grasp more of its deeper meaning. The documentary is about Jiro: one of the best sushi chefs in the world. His tiny restaurant, located in a subway station, even received a 3 Michelin star rating. So how does a man operating from a subway restaurant become the best in the world? And what can a DevOps Engineer learn from a sushi chef?</p>
<p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://culinaireambiance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_J8Bw5e9O9AfmLNdDKRRv6A-1.jpeg" alt="Jiro, the Master"  /></p>
<p>Jiro is referred to as a shokunin, a Japanese cultural phenomenon that doesn&rsquo;t have a direct translation into English. A shokunin is an artisan or a craftsman who has devoted his entire life to becoming a master of his craft. For example, there are shokunin carpenters, weavers, and blacksmiths. The shokunin achieve mastery by doing the same action over and over again and trying to improve with every repetition.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Once you decide on your occupation, you must immerse yourself in your work. You have to fall in love with your work. Never complain about your job. You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill. That&rsquo;s the secret of success and is the key to being regarded honorably.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Jiro</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<p>We get to know Jiro as a man who is devoted to his occupation. He follows the same routine every day; he even gets on the train from the same position. He says he dislikes holidays and prefers to be at work. He used to get up at 5:00 and get home after 22:00. Even at age 85, he&rsquo;s still working at the restaurant every day, simply because he doesn&rsquo;t want to do anything else.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just about putting in long hours and working past the retirement age. It&rsquo;s also about the mindset and the attitude that Jiro has adopted towards his craft:</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen many chefs who are self-critical, but I&rsquo;ve never seen another chef who is so hard on himself. He sets the standard for self-discipline. He&rsquo;s always looking ahead. He&rsquo;s never satisfied with his work. He&rsquo;s always trying to find ways to make the sushi better or to improve his skills. Even now, that&rsquo;s what he thinks about every day.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Masuhiro Yamamoto, Food Critic.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="finding-my-craft">Finding my Craft</h2>
<p>It was hard to decide on my occupation. It took me 32 years and a lot of trial and error to find the answer. I have always envied people who knew they wanted to become a nurse since childhood.</p>
<p>What occupation should I choose? I answered this question by answering another question: what do I like to do in my free time? The answer was clear: I tinkered with computers. I had already coded several websites and loved experimenting with game automation. I ran &ldquo;bot farms&rdquo; on Linux servers which I configured myself from the command line.</p>
<p>I decided to make IT and tech my occupation. Fortunately for me, the job market was in my favor, and employers were much more willing to consider candidates without a formal background in IT. If you&rsquo;d like to read more, I wrote about my journey into DevOps in <a href="/my-journey-into-devops-so-far">this article</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-ways-of-the-shokunin">The Ways of the Shokunin</h2>
<p>After making the career change, I adopted the shokunin mindset and dedicated my life to mastering my craft. In practical terms, I needed to commit to devoting my time to my profession and avoid straying from it. Making this commitment wasn&rsquo;t very difficult because I chose my career based on my free-time activities. It&rsquo;s more about adopting a mindset of striving to make everything relate to each other. For example, I try to select hobby projects that directly relate to what I&rsquo;m working with during the day. This way, my leisure activities will strengthen my professional skills, and my professional expertise will improve my hobby projects, creating a feedback loop that will eventually lead to results.</p>
<p>However, sticking to one thing does not necessarily come naturally to me. I have a tendency to pick up many different hobbies and get very excited about them. First, I will become extremely interested in a particular subject. Then, after approximately three months, I put it aside and become excited about something else. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_object_syndrome">Shiny Object Syndrome</a> because I tend to return to these hobbies in a cyclical pattern. As I apply myself to learning the skill with a feverish intensity, I&rsquo;m able to make a lot of progress during these bouts of obsession. But to the outside world, it might seem like I&rsquo;m constantly changing my mind about what I want.</p>
<p>I always considered this a negative character trait, but over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve learned to embrace it and guide this tendency in the right direction. Because I chose IT as my occupation and DevOps as an area of specialization, I gave myself a broad scope of interest with many sub-skills to learn. If you look at the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops">DevOps Roadmap</a>, you&rsquo;ll see that a good DevOps Engineer must master many different skills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve given myself a large playground with a fence around it, full of exciting things to learn. I can go down a Python rabbit hole for a few months and improve my coding skills. Later, I find myself sucked into <a href="https://mischavandenburg.com/linux-creativity/">builing my own OS</a> and learning more about Linux in the process. The fence around the playground isn&rsquo;t locked, but I do my best to stay inside the fence. When, for example, I start getting the urge to get back into music production again, I consider that it will take up a few hours a day to get back on track. Investing these hours into something that brings me joy, but is also related to my occupation, would be a better option. Reflecting in this way keeps me focused on my goals.</p>
<p>My website is another example of this fusion between professional and free-time activities. I love to write. It&rsquo;s a relaxing activity, even though it is very challenging sometimes. After I learn about a new subject, I try to write about it. This is the best way I know to verify whether I&rsquo;ve really understood the topic. When I sit down to write about something, I force myself to think clearly about it and to make sure everything aligns properly in my mind. When I cannot explain the concepts in a few clear sentences, I know I don&rsquo;t fully understand it yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can&rsquo;t exist without the other.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>William Zinsser, On Writing Well</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way my blog supports my professional development is because I prefer to write my blog posts in neovim in the markdown format. Writing and editing text often involves moving a lot of words and paragraphs around. Because I use vim to do my writing, I&rsquo;m also constantly practicing the keybinds I use for writing and editing code during my day job. I often learn a new motion for my blog writing, which I use the next day at work.</p>
<h2 id="never-finished">Never Finished</h2>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;All I want to do is make better sushi. I do the same thing over and over, improving bit by bit. There is always a yearning to achieve more. I&rsquo;ll continue to climb, trying to reach the top, but no one knows where the top is. Even at my age, after decades of work, I don&rsquo;t think I have achieved perfection. But I feel ecstatic all day. I love making sushi. That&rsquo;s the spirit of the shokunin.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Jiro</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>
<p>Jiro taught me never to be satisfied with my skills. If I desire to become a master of my craft, there will never be a point where I can lean back and think that I&rsquo;ve learned enough. There&rsquo;s always something to improve, which is why I chose an IT career. My thirst for learning cannot be quenched, and there&rsquo;s always something to learn in this field.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="devotion">Devotion</h2>
<p>Although it might seem like a simple food documentary, do not be deceived. Jiro Dreams of Sushi is full of valuable life lessons. It&rsquo;s one of the documentaries which I revisit regularly. It&rsquo;s relaxing to watch, and I get hugely inspired by Jiro&rsquo;s devotion to his craft and powerful teachings every time.</p>
<p>Jiro&rsquo;s guidance has changed my life. He made me realize that if I wished to become a master of my craft, I needed to devote my life to it. I changed my lifestyle, so the things I do in my free time strengthen my professional skills. I also became more mindful of the content I consume and the things I read, trying to keep it related to my occupation. He showed me the true meaning of the phrase &ldquo;my work is my hobby.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Always look beyond and above yourself. Always try to improve on yourself. Always strive to elevate your craft. That&rsquo;s what he taught me.&rdquo;</p>

      <title>5 Reasons Why I Changed my Career to IT in my Thirties</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/5-reasons-why-i-changed-my-career-to-it-in-my-thirties/</link>

      <description>In this post, I’d like to share the five main reasons why I changed my career to IT in my thirties. Making a career change can be daunting, especially when you are past your twenties, and employers can get more skeptical of hiring and training you. However, when I passed my twenties and became more serious and intentional about my life and career, I decided to take the plunge and hope for the best.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I’d like to share the five main reasons why I changed my career to IT in my thirties. Making a career change can be daunting, especially when you are past your twenties, and employers can get more skeptical of hiring and training you. However, when I passed my twenties and became more serious and intentional about my life and career, I decided to take the plunge and hope for the best. These are listed in no particular order.</p>
<h2 id="1-job-opportunities">#1 job opportunities</h2>
<p>IT has always been a field with many job opportunities, and with the current movements of digitalization and automation, there is no sign that it will slow down.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm">the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, “Employment in computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 13 percent from 2020 to 2030, faster than the average for all occupations. These occupations are projected to add about 667,600 new jobs. Demand for these workers will stem from greater emphasis on cloud computing, the collection and storage of big data, and information security.”</p>
<p>The situation is no different here in the Netherlands. Currently, there is a shortage of people in IT, and employers are much more willing to provide training to motivated individuals to make a change.</p>
<h2 id="2-remote-work">#2 remote work</h2>
<p>I think remote work is one of the best parts of living in post-pandemic 2022. I am an introvert, and having a quiet, stable space without distractions, which is the same from day to day, is a huge boost to my productivity.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think it is crucial to be mindful of your posture and body while working at a desk. For example, I am dependent on having a standing desk which I adjust more than ten times a day. I also need a chair suitable for my body type to avoid getting stiff and getting a sore back. Although some offices take care of providing these facilities to their employees, I think it is beneficial to invest in your own setup, which you can tailor to your own needs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, working from anywhere in the world is a massive advantage. I am not very interested in living a digital nomad lifestyle, working from a MacBook in coffee shops, but I think it’s great that you can spend some time abroad while working from that location.</p>
<h2 id="3-personal-interest">#3 personal interest</h2>
<p>This is a big one. You should not change your career to IT just because it earns well or because you think you can work from the beach in Thailand. I have been tinkering with computers and programming languages since I was a kid and have always enjoyed it. I always found myself “the computer guy” in groups of friends or colleagues.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, I never managed to make my career out of it until now, and I get a lot of satisfaction from my work every day after I made the change.</p>
<h2 id="4-high-income">#4 high income</h2>
<p>It is no secret that tech jobs are some of the best paying jobs in the U.S., having<a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#15-0000"> a mean wage of $99,860</a>. And if you work your way up into management, there are even higher salaries. Here <a href="https://www.nationaleberoepengids.nl/salaris/ict">in the Netherlands</a>, it is also a financially sound choice, with a mean wage of €47.200</p>
<h2 id="5-fast-changing-field">#5 fast-changing field</h2>
<p>IT is a broad field with many little niches you can get into, and every niche is constantly developing. Being in IT means you will need to stay on board by continuing to learn the new technologies and languages to keep on track.</p>
<p>This is also what makes it exciting to me, being a life-long learner. There is always more to learn and some cutting-edge technology to become familiar with, which can improve your workflow and your deployments.</p>

I was 31 years old and had just finished an important chapter of my life, and was ready to begin a new one. After thinking about where I wanted to steer my professional career, I decided to follow my passion for programming and automation and attempt to make a career out of my interests in tech and IT.</p>
<p>I was in a fortunate situation, because there were large shortages of people on the IT job market in The Netherlands. Consequently, employers were much more willing to train their employees to perform the roles that they required to fulfill.</p>
<h2 id="bots-and-scripts">Bots and Scripts</h2>
<p>I have always loved messing around with computers, and I learned to write small and simple programs at a very young age. At the same time I was an avid gamer, and spent many hours slaying monsters in online RPG’s. One day I came across the concept of a bot: a program that plays the computer game for you, and I was hooked. This is where I developed my ‘fetish’ for automation.</p>
<p>I was very lucky that I had a friend who shared my interests, and together we built our own automation projects (called ‘botfarms’) in which we ran large amounts of bots that played a certain game for us. This army of bots generated in-game currency which we could sell for actual money. They weren’t huge profits, but it was an amazingly satisfying feeling to be the overlords of an army of automations that actually generated some income for us.</p>
<h2 id="from-bots-to-devops">From Bots to DevOps</h2>
<p>These botfarms were hosted on servers which set up ourselves. In order to save costs we rented Linux servers, and I spent many evenings figuring out how configure them via the command line. Often I would suddenly snap out of my flow at 3am and realise I had to go to work at 7 in the morning again.</p>
<p>Although I did not manage to make these personal interests into a personal career, my friend eventually became a Data Engineer. After making the decision to make a career switch to IT I needed to figure out which direction I wanted to go in, because IT covers a very broad range of topics and skills. Based on on our shared interests and previous projects, he recommended me to become a DevOps Engineer.</p>
<p>I very quickly realised that he was right on the money with his suggestion and I started to become very enthusiastic to learn how to make a living by working with computers and automation.</p>
<h2 id="traineeship">Traineeship</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, employers in The Netherlands are now willing to train potential candidates, and I used my hobby projects as a way to demonstrate my genuine interest and affinity with IT and automation. I was offered a traineeship to become a DevOps Engineer in 2021. After a period of training I started working for the City of Amsterdam and I&rsquo;ve been part of an IT4IT operations team since.</p>
