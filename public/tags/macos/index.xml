      <title>Remove Backgrounds from Images using MacOS Preview</title>

      <description>Removing backgrounds from images is always an annoying task which I always need to google. And every time I end up on a different website where you can upload an image and then download a low-resolution version without the background, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay for the high-resolution.
Turns out MacOS preview can do this just fine. I keep finding these little gems in MacOS that completely remove the need for any external app or saas.</description>

<p>It worked really well</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just released a comprehensive video delving deep into my Neovim setup and command-line centric workflow. This video is a response to the curiosity of my YouTube subscribers. It&amp;rsquo;s an all-inclusive guide from A to Z, detailing the rationale behind my configuration choices. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent years perfecting my workflow and this video has been several months in the making, so I&amp;rsquo;m excited that I can finally share it with you.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just released a comprehensive video delving deep into my Neovim setup and command-line centric workflow. This video is a response to the curiosity of my YouTube subscribers. It&rsquo;s an all-inclusive guide from A to Z, detailing the rationale behind my configuration choices. I&rsquo;ve spent years perfecting my workflow and this video has been several months in the making, so I&rsquo;m excited that I can finally share it with you.</p>
<p>My workflow is completely based on the command line.
I therefore have very little programs or tools running on the graphical side of the OS, whether it be MacOS or Linux. All I need is the terminal and a web browser, but a window manager is a big bonus to my productivity.</p>
<p>My main philosophy is to have a minimalistic workflow which uses very little resources. It should be a distraction-free,
keyboard centered and efficient environment to do my best work.</p>

      <title>Converting markdown to PDF on MacOS</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/pandoc-markdown-pdf-macos/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/pandoc-markdown-pdf-macos/</guid>
      <description>It happens that I want to share my notes with friends that just simply want a pdf instead of a markdown file.
This morning I figured out a quick way to convert markdown to pdf on a M2 MacBook running MacOS Ventura.
You need the pandoc and wkhtmltopdf packages.
brew install pandoc wkhtmltopdf To convert:
pandoc 00-zettelkasten/Fundamentals\ of\ Bicep.md --pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf -o /tmp/test.pdf This will output a pdf to my /tmp/ directory and it looks pretty good.</description>

<p>To convert all markdown files in a directory you can use a wildcard:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">pandoc 00-zettelkasten/*.md --pdf-engine<span class="o">=</span>wkhtmltopdf  -o /tmp/test.pdf
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Fun fact: converting my entire zettelkasten took a few seconds and generated a document of 80 pages with a font size of 10. Pretty fun to see it in a more regular format instead of the terminal.</p>

      <title>Running Docker and Kubernetes on Mac M2</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/docker-kubernetes-on-mac-m2/</link>

      <description>The past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out a few options to run Docker containers and a Kubernetes clusters on my new MacBook Pro M2.
Unfortunately you can&amp;rsquo;t just run brew install docker and expect it to work. Additionally, Docker desktop requires that you purchase a license if you use it for work purposes.
Minikube works fine as well, but the networking driver for qemu is not fully supported yet, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried any of the other alternatives because I found something better.</description>

<p>Unfortunately you can&rsquo;t just run <code>brew install docker</code> and expect it to work. Additionally, Docker desktop requires that you purchase a license if you use it for work purposes.</p>
<p>Minikube works fine as well, but the networking driver for qemu is not fully supported yet, and I haven&rsquo;t tried any of the other alternatives because I found something better.</p>
<p>Rancher Desktop provides everything that you need. It sets up a local VM where it will run a Kubernetes cluster using k3s. It will configure the containerd container engine for you which you can interact with using <code>nerdctl</code>.</p>
<p>To install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew install rancher
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">#after installing rancher, start it up and wait for it to boot the VM.</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">alias</span> <span class="nv">docker</span><span class="o">=</span>nerdctl
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">docker run hello-world
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And you&rsquo;re good to go. Rancher will add the rancher-desktop to your kube context.</p>
<p>To test your Kubernetes cluster:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">k get pods
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">k get nodes
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># test running a pod</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">k run nginx --image<span class="o">=</span>nginx
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">k expose pod nginx --port<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">80</span> --type<span class="o">=</span>NodePort
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># inspect your services and look for 80:31066/TCP under PORT(S)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">k get svc
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">curl localhost:31066
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Or visit localhost:31066 in your browser. Replace 31066 with the port you found listed under your services.</p>

      <title>Controlling Apple Music with hotkeys from anywhere on MacOS</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/apple-music-hotkeys/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a little obsessed with controlling everything with my keyboard. That&amp;rsquo;s why I loved AwesomeWM so much on my Arch Linux setup, I hardly used my mouse anymore.
One thing I loved about my setup was the ability to control my music from the keyboard from anywhere. This is a feature I picked up from the awesome-copycats theme for AwesomeWM. This was one of the first things I missed when I made my switch to MacOS.</description>

<p>One thing I loved about my setup was the ability to control my music from the keyboard from anywhere. This is a feature I picked up from the awesome-copycats theme for AwesomeWM. This was one of the first things I missed when I made my switch to MacOS.</p>
<p>I started using Apple Music as my music app but it does not have any global hotkeys, and it makes you use a widget with the mouse.</p>
<h1 id="skhd">skhd</h1>
<p>I solved the problem using <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd">skhd</a>. This is a free hotkey daemon for MacOS. To install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew services start skhd
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then I added the following to my skhd config file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># Control apple music globally</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># Based on Aesome-copycats theme for AesomeWM</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">ctrl + cmd + fn - up : osascript -e <span class="s1">&#39;tell app &#34;Music&#34; to playpause&#39;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">ctrl + cmd + fn - left : osascript -e <span class="s1">&#39;tell app &#34;Music&#34; to back track&#39;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">ctrl + cmd + fn - right : osascript -e <span class="s1">&#39;tell app &#34;Music&#34; to play next track&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h1 id="links">links</h1>

      <title>New Laptop: Moving to MacOS</title>

      <description>My new employer kindly sponsored me with a new 16-inch MacBook Pro M2. I chose 32GB Ram and the base model with 12 CPU and 19 GPU cores and 1TB of hard disk. These specifications will suit my needs well.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been daily driving Linux for a year now, and it has been such an incredible journey. Building my own Arch Linux system taught me much about Linux and what it means to maintain a system yourself.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My new employer kindly sponsored me with a new 16-inch MacBook Pro M2. I chose 32GB Ram and the base model with 12 CPU and 19 GPU cores and 1TB of hard disk. These specifications will suit my needs well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been daily driving Linux for a year now, and it has been such an incredible journey. Building my own Arch Linux system taught me much about Linux and what it means to maintain a system yourself. I will undoubtedly miss my custom AwesomeWM configuration and the freedom that Arch provides.</p>
<p>Technically I could have chosen a Windows laptop and installed Linux on it. But I went for a Mac for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility. I&rsquo;ll be doing contracts for various customers, so I&rsquo;ll likely run into environments where I&rsquo;ll need to use some software, such as a VPN that is not supported on Linux. MacOS will always be compatible everywhere.</li>
<li>Portability. I&rsquo;ll probably be going to the office multiple times a week, and using a MacBook as a daily driver will allow me to take my full setup with me everywhere. I also plan to spend some time abroad, and using a MacBook as a daily driver will allow me to work remotely for extended periods.</li>
<li>Stability. Even though my Linux systems never really broke on me, there is always a possibility. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that with MacOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;ll be switching to my MacBook as my primary workstation, I will continue using Linux for my hobby projects and home lab. So there will be plenty of opportunity to keep growing in that area in the future.</p>
