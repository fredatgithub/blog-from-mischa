      <title>Controlling Apple Music with hotkeys from anywhere on MacOS</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a little obsessed with controlling everything with my keyboard. That&amp;rsquo;s why I loved AwesomeWM so much on my Arch Linux setup, I hardly used my mouse anymore.
One thing I loved about my setup was the ability to control my music from the keyboard from anywhere. This is a feature I picked up from the awesome-copycats theme for AwesomeWM. This was one of the first things I missed when I made my switch to MacOS.</description>

<p>One thing I loved about my setup was the ability to control my music from the keyboard from anywhere. This is a feature I picked up from the awesome-copycats theme for AwesomeWM. This was one of the first things I missed when I made my switch to MacOS.</p>
<p>I started using Apple Music as my music app but it does not have any global hotkeys, and it makes you use a widget with the mouse.</p>
<h1 id="skhd">skhd</h1>
<p>I solved the problem using <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd">skhd</a>. This is a free hotkey daemon for MacOS. To install:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew services start skhd
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then I added the following to my skhd config file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># Control apple music globally</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># Based on Aesome-copycats theme for AesomeWM</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">ctrl + cmd + fn - up : osascript -e <span class="s1">&#39;tell app &#34;Music&#34; to playpause&#39;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">ctrl + cmd + fn - left : osascript -e <span class="s1">&#39;tell app &#34;Music&#34; to back track&#39;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">ctrl + cmd + fn - right : osascript -e <span class="s1">&#39;tell app &#34;Music&#34; to play next track&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h1 id="links">links</h1>

      <title>New Laptop: Moving to MacOS</title>

      <description>My new employer kindly sponsored me with a new 16-inch MacBook Pro M2. I chose 32GB Ram and the base model with 12 CPU and 19 GPU cores and 1TB of hard disk. These specifications will suit my needs well.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been daily driving Linux for a year now, and it has been such an incredible journey. Building my own Arch Linux system taught me much about Linux and what it means to maintain a system yourself.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been daily driving Linux for a year now, and it has been such an incredible journey. Building my own Arch Linux system taught me much about Linux and what it means to maintain a system yourself. I will undoubtedly miss my custom AwesomeWM configuration and the freedom that Arch provides.</p>
<p>Technically I could have chosen a Windows laptop and installed Linux on it. But I went for a Mac for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility. I&rsquo;ll be doing contracts for various customers, so I&rsquo;ll likely run into environments where I&rsquo;ll need to use some software, such as a VPN that is not supported on Linux. MacOS will always be compatible everywhere.</li>
<li>Portability. I&rsquo;ll probably be going to the office multiple times a week, and using a MacBook as a daily driver will allow me to take my full setup with me everywhere. I also plan to spend some time abroad, and using a MacBook as a daily driver will allow me to work remotely for extended periods.</li>
<li>Stability. Even though my Linux systems never really broke on me, there is always a possibility. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that with MacOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;ll be switching to my MacBook as my primary workstation, I will continue using Linux for my hobby projects and home lab. So there will be plenty of opportunity to keep growing in that area in the future.</p>
