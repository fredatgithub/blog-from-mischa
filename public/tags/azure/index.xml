      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m typing this 30 minutes after I passed my AZ-400 exam. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in a lovely cafe on Leidseplein in Amsterdam and feel relieved. Another significant certification bites the dust. This one took about 70 hours of study.
I started preparing immediately after passing my AZ-104 exam, which was a good move. The AZ-400 requires you to know many details about Azure services and how to access them. For example, Shared Access Signatures are only used for accessing storage accounts, but they came up quite often as alternative answers to the questions.</description>

For example, Shared Access Signatures are only used for accessing storage accounts, but they came up quite often as alternative answers to the questions.</p>
<p>The exam itself was difficult, but the AZ-104 was harder. The AZ-104 exam was more challenging because the questions were complicated and required you to simultaneously balance many different factors in the mind. The AZ-400 was difficult because the answer alternatives that are provided are incredibly similar to each other, and they make you very insecure about what the right choice might be. As a result, I changed my answers many times.</p>
<p>I will do another study guide for this certification soon and publish my notes and Anki deck too. Now it&rsquo;s time to celebrate and relax a little.</p>

      <title>Azure DevOps Personal Access Tokens are always for authenticating into ADO</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/azure-personal-access-tokens/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/azure-personal-access-tokens/</guid>
      <description>The PAT (Personal Access Token) often comes up during practice tests for the AZ-400.
One way to remember when to use a PAT is that these are only for authenticating into Azure DevOps, never to external services.
For example, you might get a question on connecting your Azure DevOps project with a GitHub account from Azure DevOps, and PAT will show up as one of the alternative answers. By remembering that PATs are only for authenticating into ADO, you can elminate this alternative, and make your choice easier.</description>

      <title>How to build and deploy a Docker container to an Azure VM using Azure Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/docker-to-azure-vm/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/docker-to-azure-vm/</guid>
      <description>I wanted to build an application from a Dockerfile and deploy it to a VM. I used a default Svelte setup as an example app.
Naturally, Azure prefers that you deploy containers to services such as Azure Container Instances or App Services, so they don&amp;rsquo;t provide modules for the pipelines to deploy to docker servers as far as I could tell.
I searched for a long time but I could not find a solution.</description>

      <description>To reach a VM from Azure Pipelines, you need to set up an environment.
Create your Linux VM in Azure.
In Azure DevOps, click envirnoments, new, and select the Virtual Machine option.
A command is generated for you. SSH into your VM and run the command.
Now the VM should show up under environments in Azure DevOps.
Set up a repo with an azure-pipelines.yml with these contents to test. under environment, set the same name as you did in Azure DevOps for your environment.</description>

      <description>Telemetry is the collection of measurements or other data at remote points, and transmitting that data to a receiver for monitoring.
Sampling is used to reduce telemetry traffic and costs for storage and data in Application Insights.
For small and medium sized applications sampling is generally not necessary.
Advantages of sampling:
Throttling data when the application suddenly sends a high volume of telemetry in a short time This saves costs! Keeping a pricing tier quota Reduce network traffic from telemetry collection Three different kinds of sampling:</description>

      <title>Pipelines: Continuous Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/pipelines-continuous-monitoring/</link>

      <guid>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/pipelines-continuous-monitoring/</guid>
      <description>This term can be confusing. Initially I thought it meant monitoring of the pipelines themselves. However, in the context of Azure Release Pipelines, continuous monitoring refers to something else.
Continuous monitoring leverages metrics from other services such as Application Insights. You can set up release gates based on these metrics. For example, you can set up a release gate to roll back the deployment if an alert is being fired for high CPU usage in the application.</description>

      <description>Debugging is done using call stacks in monolithic applications. Nowadays it is more common to deploy an application using a microservices architecture. Microservices make it easier to update certain parts of the application, and allow for more frequent deployments.
Using microservices does have a disadvantage: you cannot use the local call stack for debugging, because calls are sent to different microservices.
Distributed tracing is an implementation of the call stack in the cloud.</description>

      <description>TLDR It took me 80 hours of studying to gain this certification. Here are my notes and Anki deck: GitHub repo
Introduction When I did my English degree at University, exams were usually handwritten essays that needed to be done within a 3-hour timeframe. Sometimes we had multiple-choice tests, and I would always consider them a guaranteed pass because multiple-choice was much easier in my experience.
That opinion has changed since I&amp;rsquo;ve obtained a few IT certifications.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="tldr">TLDR</h1>
<p>It took me 80 hours of studying to gain this certification. Here are my notes and Anki deck:
<a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/az-104-azure-administrator">GitHub repo</a></p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>When I did my English degree at University, exams were usually handwritten essays that needed to be done within a 3-hour timeframe. Sometimes we had multiple-choice tests, and I would always consider them a guaranteed pass because multiple-choice was much easier in my experience.</p>
<p>That opinion has changed since I&rsquo;ve obtained a few IT certifications. These tests are hard! I&rsquo;m typing this while sitting on the bus on my way home from my AZ-104 exam. I passed with an 860 score of 1000, where 700 or higher is a pass. But it was an astonishingly tough exam. Usually, I finish quickly and spend at least half an hour reviewing my answers. I had only 5 minutes to review my questions this time because I had used up all of the available time. The questions required intense concentration and were time-consuming because I needed to compare many options which were very similar to each other. There were no easy questions.</p>
<h1 id="preparation">Preparation</h1>
<p>I studied 80 hours for this exam in a month. I work full-time as a DevOps Engineer, so I study in the evenings and on weekends. I have my Azure Fundamentals and CKA, but I only work with Azure occasionally in my current role.</p>
<p>Here is what I did to prepare for my exam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through all of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-104">Microsoft Learn modules for the AZ-104</a></li>
<li>Watch the entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nGlGPWs9xaLKT1KfwqREHbs">AZ-104 study list by John Savill</a></li>
<li>Practice exams on <a href="https://tutorialsdojo.com/">TutorialsDojo</a> until I could pass them with 90%+ scores</li>
<li>Microsoft ESI practice exams</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/exam-readiness-zone/preparing-for-az-104-manage-azure-identities-and-governance-1-of-5">Microsoft AZ-104 Exam prep videos</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microsoft-learn">Microsoft Learn</h2>
<p>You really need to master all of the subject matter. Only completing the Microsoft Learn modules is not enough preparation. They are more like summaries. At the end of each module, they provide links to the documentation for the subject for further study. Unfortunately, Microsoft does not go easy on you. It expects you to know obscure details of nearly every service this exam covers. Therefore, I advise going beyond the Microsoft Learn modules and studying the linked articles after each module.</p>
<h2 id="youtube-az-104-study-playlist-by-john-savill">YouTube AZ-104 Study Playlist by John Savill</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s better to watch this playlist first and then do the Microsoft modules or the other way around. I did the Microsoft modules first, but for my next exam (AZ-400 DevOps Expert), I&rsquo;ll start with the videos and then do the Microsoft Learn modules.</p>
<h2 id="tutorialsdojo">Tutorialsdojo</h2>
<p>These practice exams are excellent. I used them in preparation for my fundamentals exam.</p>
<p>The best thing about them is that they provide extensive documentation and explanation of the questions. So after you finish the exam, you can study a lot with these examples.</p>
<h2 id="esi-practice-exams">ESI Practice Exams</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re lucky if your organization participates in Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="esi.microsoft.com/">Enterprise Skills Initiative</a>. The practice exams provided in the ESI environment give you a good indication of what you can expect at the exam. I first did the Tutorialsdojo exams and then moved on to the ESI exams, and I was humiliated. The ESI questions are very complex and hard to solve, and I learned a lot from these exams.</p>
<p>There are 210 questions total, and I worked through all of them, and whenever I failed a question, I did a deeper dive into the question&rsquo;s theme.</p>
<h1 id="studying">studying</h1>
<p>I take notes in Obsidian, and I use Anki for spaced repetition. I highly recommend keeping a deck of Anki cards and continuously testing yourself. You will need to memorize a lot of details. For example, you are expected to remember that storage accounts of the FileStorage type do not support Geo Redundant Storage. You can find my Anki deck in the <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/az-104-azure-administrator">GitHub repo.</a></p>
