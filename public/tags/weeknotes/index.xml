      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a very busy week at work, but I&amp;rsquo;m doing interesting things. I&amp;rsquo;ve deployed a new Application Gateway from scratch, and I&amp;rsquo;m setting up new workloads from the bottom up. This means I have to set up the pipelines and write all the code for the required infrastructure such as virtual networks and private dns zones. When that is deployed I deploy a new AKS cluster for the workload which also involves quite a lot of steps because I need to make a bunch of network peerings and add new firewall rules.</description>

I&rsquo;ve deployed a new Application Gateway from scratch, and I&rsquo;m setting up new workloads from the bottom up. This means I have to set up the pipelines and write all the code for the required infrastructure such as virtual networks and private dns zones. When that is deployed I deploy a new AKS cluster for the workload which also involves quite a lot of steps because I need to make a bunch of network peerings and add new firewall rules. But it&rsquo;s quite exciting work and it is fun to set things up from scratch.</p>
<p>On Thursday I traveled to the Fullstaq office to attend an all-company meeting, where the leadership announced that we&rsquo;re becoming a part of <a href="https://www.thedigitalneighborhood.com/">The Digital Neighborhood</a>, which is an interesting development. I think it can lead to even more knowledge sharing and career opportunities within the group.</p>
<p>On Friday I started expermenting with using ChatGPT and Azure OpenAI with my own data. I listened to an <a href="/zet/podcast-azure-openai/">interesting podcast</a> which inspired me to try out Azure OpenAI and build something myself.</p>
<p>I created a fun project where I took the Collected Teachings of Ajahn Chah and fed it to my custom ChatGPT instance. I made <a href="/zet/video-azure-openai-chah-first-demo/">a video about the project.</a></p>
<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>I set a new 10K PR this Saturday and I&rsquo;ve been going out for my morning runs steadily this week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struggling a bit with the weight loss. On the company meeting there was tasty food being offered and I overate, and on Saturday I attended a meeting where there was junk food available and I ate some sugary treats and carbohydrate rich foods. This immediately led to poorer sleep as well, so it was a valuable lesson that it is always better to stick to the programme.</p>

      <description>I feel calmer now, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any meetups or social events this week. I&amp;rsquo;ve been less busy and had more time for meditation and yoga and I can notice the effects instantly. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling more relaxed and I allow myself more time for reading.
On the other hand I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite productive on the content creation side. And to create the content, I experiment on my Lab subscription in Azure, which bring me a lot of learning and experience at the same time, so it is a great win-win situation.</description>

<p>I released a few YouTube videos and blog posts and I notice that it brings me energy. It feels good to be able to give something back to the community.</p>
<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>Running is going well now. Increased my weekly distance with 4km for a total of 31,35km this week. Went for a 55m long run, 8,5km yesterday and felt good! I started reading &lsquo;Eat and Run&rsquo; and watching some motivational videos which helped me find more pleasure in running again.</p>
<p>Weight has remained stable.</p>

<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<p>I finished Finding Ultra and A Simple Path to Wealth. Some notes can be found <a href="/zet/book-notes-simple-path-to-wealth/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Started reading &ldquo;Eat and Run&rdquo; by Jurek, another vegan ultrarunner. I&rsquo;m abot 30% in already and it is an inspiring story so far, with a lot of practical advice added in between.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m branching out my fiction reading. I haven&rsquo;t been reading much fiction these past few years. I never read any science fiction but now I felt like exploring that world, especially around AI.</p>
<p>After some Reddit searches I ended up with the Polity series by Neal Asher which received a lot of praise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only started reading it but it is well written so far and I find myself getting into it and wanting to read more. Let&rsquo;s see where this goes!</p>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty good week, less busy than last week. I went to Azure Lowlands and I&amp;rsquo;ve been creating a lot of YouTube videos.
Exercise &amp;amp; Weight Loss I went out for runs 5 times a week.
My long run was 50 minutes and 8,24km, which is 5m more than last week. Improvement!
The morning runs were all 5k every time, except for monday which was 4,16km.
Although I&amp;rsquo;m back on track with the running I start noticing a dip in the motivation now that I have a good baseline established.</description>

<p>I went out for runs 5 times a week.</p>
<p>My long run was 50 minutes and 8,24km, which is 5m more than last week. Improvement!</p>
<p>The morning runs were all 5k every time, except for monday which was 4,16km.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m back on track with the running I start noticing a dip in the motivation now that I have a good baseline established. I need to find some new inspiration and motivation.</p>
<p>I think I should start logging weekly distance again. During May my weekly distance hovered around 33km, but then I started working on increasing my cadence to 170+ spm, so the distances became shorter as expected. Additionally, pulling an all-nighter for Graspop really deregulated my schedule and training, but now I&rsquo;m back on track.</p>
<p>Last week total was 20km, this week total was 27km.</p>
<p>To get more motivation I&rsquo;ll start tracking weekly totals again and try to keep increasing them again. Maybe try to have acouple of 6K morning runs this week.</p>
<p>My weight was down 1kg from last week.</p>
<h2 id="content-consumption">Content Consumption</h2>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Finished reading &ldquo;Finding Ultra&rdquo;. Very inspiring book.</p>
<p>Also finished The Simple Path to Wealth by JJ Collins. It was an inspiring read, assuring me of my investing strategy of putting everything in index funds.</p>
<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched much YouTube this week. I&rsquo;ve been focused on creating them!</p>

      <description>Week 25 My Week It has been a very busy week! On Tuesday I attended the Dutch Azure Meetup where I saw a presentation of the Azure Cloud Journey of the NS, which is the national Dutch train company, where I currently work. It was very insightful and nice to connect with colleagues and meet new people.
Went to the Beyond Blue office on Wednesday, and on Thursday I attended a Knowledge Atrium session at Microsoft Headquarters in Amsterdam.</description>

<p>It has been a very busy week! On Tuesday I attended the Dutch Azure Meetup where I saw a presentation of the Azure Cloud Journey of the NS, which is the national Dutch train company, where I currently work. It was very insightful and nice to connect with colleagues and meet new people.</p>
<p>Went to the Beyond Blue office on Wednesday, and on Thursday I attended a Knowledge Atrium session at Microsoft Headquarters in Amsterdam. What an experience! I witnessed a really cool demonstration of GitHub Copilot, and received other presentations about Azure Always On and Virtual Network Manager. I was very inspired by all of the new features and upcoming changes, and I felt the energy to start producing some more content again on my blog and YouTube channel.</p>
<p>I managed to create two videos and I typed out a couple of blog posts which I will release next week probably.</p>
<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>After the festival and routine disruption from last week, it was hard getting back into the regime because I was having such a busy week at the same time.</p>
<p>However, I managed to go for 4 runs in the early mornings nonetheless, and I did a 45 minute long run of 7km on Saturday morning. So I&rsquo;m definitely getting back on track.</p>
<p>My weight has dropped a bit from losing water weight, but I&rsquo;ve stalled otherwise. The meetups and social engagments all had delicious food offerings, but I&rsquo;ve been very strong and I completely prepped out all of my food beforehand and I stuck to that program. However, I did eat a few extra handfuls of nuts here and there, so I have been in a caloric deficit for only half the week. Still adjusting.</p>
<h2 id="content-consumption">Content Consumption</h2>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Started reading &ldquo;The Simple Path to Wealth&rdquo;. Very insightful so far. Also finished reading &ldquo;The Richest Man in Babylon&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>Not much time to watch videos. But I did create two videos after quite a break from my YouTube channel.</p>
<h3 id="listening">Listening</h3>
<p>Mostly listening to Dutch personal finance podcasts.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<h1 id="next-week">Next Week</h1>
<p>I will attend Azure Lowlands on Thursday and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to that! Otherwise the week seems much more quiet and I don&rsquo;t have any other engagements planned for a change. I hope to finish up on some lingering chores and maybe create some more content.</p>

      <description>Week 24 My Week This weeks main event was Graspop! I went there on Friday together with my brother. The main reason for going was seeing Meshuggah live for the first time.
It was an amazing experience. I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to Meshuggah since I was 16 years old so it was awesome to see them live. They are getting pretty old so it was good that I managed to see them now.</description>

<h2 id="my-week">My Week</h2>
<p>This weeks main event was Graspop! I went there on Friday together with my brother. The main reason for going was seeing Meshuggah live for the first time.</p>
<p>It was an amazing experience. I&rsquo;ve been listening to Meshuggah since I was 16 years old so it was awesome to see them live. They are getting pretty old so it was good that I managed to see them now. Perhaps they quit in a year or two?</p>
<p>We left at noon on Friday, drove to Belgium and attended the festival. Meshuggah started playing at midnight, so it was a long day! I was back home at 4:30 in the morning. This hasn&rsquo;t happened for years. I didn&rsquo;t sleep at all, and this lack of sleep and the unusuallly high stimulation of the concert has had a lot of impact on my sleep, mood and weight.</p>
<p>I completely derailed my schedule and routines, but it was all worth it.</p>
<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>After ending my 2 month challenge and reaching my goal of 75kg, I had a week of less strict adherence.</p>
<p>I ate more calories, more carbs, and I even bought some junk food again. Not good. My average weight climbed back up to 77,63kg in a single week!</p>
<p>Now, a lot of this weight will be water weight because I ate more carbs. But still it&rsquo;s shocking to see how quickly the scale moves upward after loosening the reigns a bit.</p>
<p>I feel quite disappointed about that and it definitely wasn&rsquo;t worth the pleasure of the junk food and eating more. It actually feels good to get back in control and to start tracking and planning my nutrition very carefully again starting Monday.</p>
<p>I went for two 5k runs this week. Far less than I would like. The festival has completely derailed my usual routines and schedule. I didn&rsquo;t sleep for an entire night which left me completely incapable the next two days, so I missed two exercise opportunities there. But it was all worth it. I look forward to get back into my Program and usual routine again next week.</p>

<p>On Wednesday I&rsquo;ll have an office day at Fullstaq, and I&rsquo;ll be attending an event at Microsoft on Thursday.</p>
<p>So lots lof traveling and social activity. That will take up a lot of energy, but I&rsquo;m prepared for it.</p>
<p>I spent my sunday preparing almost all of my nutrition for the week so I won&rsquo;t make any bad food choices when I&rsquo;m tired.</p>

      <description>Week 23 My Week It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy week with a lot of social engagements. I had a nice dinner with my colleagues and I was supposed to do a Mud Run on Friday. Unfortunately I got stuck in massive traffic and I missed the start.
4 months ago I joined Fullstaq, and they have a related company called Beyond Blue, who focus on Microsoft Azure. After some conversations with my colleagues I decided to go all-in on Azure and join Beyond Blue instead.</description>

<p>4 months ago I joined Fullstaq, and they have a related company called Beyond Blue, who focus on Microsoft Azure. After some conversations with my colleagues I decided to go all-in on Azure and join Beyond Blue instead. Feels goood!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also doing a lot of thinking about renting versus buying and planning my financial future.</p>
<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>2 months ago I set up my 2 month challenge, and on Sunday I weighed in at 75,2kg. I made it! I had been stuck on the 76kg plateau for over 6 months, but I finally managed to break through.</p>
<p>My average SPM has increased to 170 during my morning runs. I did fewer runs becuase of the engagements.</p>

      <description>Week 22 My Week It has been a busy week with two office days. Committing to an exercise routine of at least 1 hour a day before work and ensuring optimal nutrition is taking up a lot of time, but it is of course all worth it.
To ensure appropriate nutrient intake, and inspired by Bryan Johnson&amp;rsquo;s Blueprint, I started meal prepping again. I was resistant to this because I prefer my food to be freshly prepared every day, but it is time consuming and the increased business of my schedule does not allow for this currently.</description>

<p>To ensure appropriate nutrient intake, and inspired by Bryan Johnson&rsquo;s Blueprint, I started meal prepping again.

<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m making good progress. I lost 0.4kg this week, average weight: 76.23kg</p>
<p>Adjusting my macros to higher fats and less carbohydrates seems to leave me more satiated after meals.</p>
<p>In terms of running, I&rsquo;m making good progress too.</p>
<h1 id="week-22---7">Week 22 - 7</h1>
<ul>
<li>Easy Run 1 Mon 32min</li>
<li>Easy Run 2 Tue 31min</li>
<li>Easy Run 3 Thu 31min</li>
<li>Easy Run 4 Fri 30min</li>
<li>Long Run   Sat 43min</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Total distance: 26,06km</li>
</ul>
<p>I started focusing on staying in the right HR zone (131 -141, zone 2) and increasing my cadence. And it worked! Most runs this week were at an average SPM between 162 and 167. I have to run a lot faster than I&rsquo;m used to in order to get to this HR/cadence, and I need to put in a lot more effort, but it does give good results. The runs are shorter because of this, but I now do a 15 minutes of warming up with walking and 10 minutes of cooling down walking, which are not added to these numbers. It now feels more like running than jogging. As expected a lower total distance this week, this is now my new baseline to build on.</p>

      <description>Week 21 My Week This week was a bit busier with two planned office days. Had an insightful conversation about my pension and future financial situation which made me think about whether I should consider purchasing property or keep renting.
Had a fun pizza workshop at work where we made original Napolitan pizza. They also offered a &amp;ldquo;Pizza Marinara&amp;rdquo; option which only used tomato sauce, oregano and olive oil. Perfect for plant-based me, and it was delicious!</description>

<p>Another adventure happened. Recently I&rsquo;ve been following Samurai Matcha on YouTube and I became very inspired by his content. I saw that he was making a trip through Europe, and I invited him to stay with me if he was in the neighborhood. To my great surprise he emailed me the next day!</p>
<p>He stayed with me and we had a great time together. He performed a tea ceremony with delicious matcha tea for me, and we visited the Japanese Fair in Leiden together. Good times!</p>

      <description>Week 20 My Week It was a nice week. I had an extra day off on Asenscion day and I decided to go for a camping trip for the first time after I moved back to the Netherlands.
It was a great experience, and I wrote a couple of Tumblr posts with photos:

<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>Went on a 12km hike on my camping trip.</p>
<p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/367c8cf46a5fdb8da612cff940e0a518/14d791b71c6209c9-fa/s1280x1920/e9c218d15016a7ac6eaa7397e14510db581c0016.jpg" alt=""  /></p>
<p>But I also managed to get my 5 runs in. One of them on Sunday morning, in the woods on my camping trip. It is going well and I am progressing nicely with my base building. Weekly distance increased with 0.5km.</p>
<h1 id="week-20---5">Week 20 - 5</h1>
<ul>
<li>Easy Run 1 Tue 44min</li>
<li>Easy Run 2 Wed 55min</li>
<li>Easy Run 3 Thu 47min</li>
<li>Easy Run 4 Sun 42min</li>
<li>Long Run   Fri 86min</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Total distance: 32,8km</li>
</ul>
<p>Weight loss is also progressing well. I missed a couple of weigh-ins because of the camping trip so I don&rsquo;t have a reliable weekly average. But on Monday I weighed 75.5kg, due to a lot of lost water weight from the trip. This is the first time I see the 75 on the scale, after being on a 76kg plateau for more than 6 months, so it was a big moment. But since it was water weight, I bumped back to 76.6kg the next day, which is still a good progression from last week.</p>

      <description>Week 19 It has been a good week. Very busy at work with AKS cluster maintenance, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working some evenings.
On Saturday I had a lovely dinner with a good friend from Norway who was passing through Amsterdam on his way back to Oslo from a trip to France.
Recently I started planning my holiday to Norway, and this has awakened the outdoorsman in me again. In my 9 years in Norway I became a seasoned traveler of mountains and forests, often staying out for weeks, but after I moved back to the Netherlands and focused on changing my career to IT, this outdoorsman has lain dormant.</description>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m going through all my gear again and purchasing some missing pieces, because I donated some gear when I left Norway. Planning to do camping trips in the Netherlands as well!</p>

<p>After last week&rsquo;s plateau I increased the strictness of my protocols. I was very strict with counting calories this week and kept strictly to One Meal A Day, and it has had good effects. I lost 0,64kg this week and my average weight is 76,91 now. My goal is 75kg for this weight loss bout.</p>

<p>Came across this reddit post:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/13a20pi/seneca_knew/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/13a20pi/seneca_knew/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=3</a></p>
<p>This rekindled my interest in Stoicism. I&rsquo;ve always been charmed by the Stoic philosophy and I implemented many elements of it in my own spiritual practice, consciously and unconsciously. But I now feel like taking a bit more structured approach towards an exploration of Stoicism. I&rsquo;m particularly interested in seeing how it overlaps with my Buddhist practice.</p>
<p>The Daily Stoic website has been on my radar for a while, but I did some reading this week and it seems like a great resource. I signed up for the daily email:</p>
<p><a href="https://dailystoic.com/dailyemail">https://dailystoic.com/dailyemail</a></p>
<p>I started reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.</p>

<p>The Daily Stoic emails have been very informative and provided an excellent reading list.</p>
<p>Introduction to Stoicism:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brief synopsis on this particular school of
Hellenistic philosophy: Stoicism was founded in Athens
by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC, but
was famously practiced by the likes of Epictetus, Cato,
Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. The philosophy asserts
that virtue (such as wisdom) is happiness and judgment
should be based on behavior, rather than words. That
we don’t control and cannot rely on external events,
only ourselves and our responses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An interesting video series about the Fjallraven brand:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of Norrona, but I&rsquo;m falling head over heels in love with Fjallraven. I love the fact that they create products to last for generations. There are many instances of grandchildren inheriting pieces of gear from their grandfathers and continuing to use them.</p>

      <description>Week 18 My Week It has been a pretty good week. Rather busy at work with some unforeseen trouble for our production patching windows, which required rescheduling everything. Managed to clean up 2800 lines of code 🧹
Went to see Sabaton and had a great time.
Otherwise I&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing for the Diablo 2 Ladder Reset and played from Friday afternoon.

<p>It has been a pretty good week. Rather busy at work with some unforeseen trouble for our production patching windows, which required rescheduling everything. Managed to clean up 2800 lines of code 🧹</p>
<p>Went to see Sabaton and had a great time.</p>
<p>Otherwise I&rsquo;ve been preparing for the Diablo 2 Ladder Reset and played from Friday afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>My weight loss plateaued this week. I had two days where I overate, and I didn&rsquo;t do any 5:2 fasting this week. I&rsquo;m adjusting my daily calories downward to 1600 calories a day, eating only one meal a day.</p>
<p>Before I sometimes had a smaller meal at 16:00 to tide me over to dinner and to increase the protein consumption. But now I&rsquo;m sticking to strict OMAD (One Meal A Day).</p>
<p>I did keep up my exercise routine. The base building is going well, I set a new record by running 67 minutes today, and I didn&rsquo;t have any knee pain. I went for two strength workouts as well.</p>

<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>
<p>Having a lot of fun with the Diablo 2 reset. I haven&rsquo;t gamed for months, but it is fun to be back at it for a little bit. Everybody is poor and people are collaborating to finish the game.</p>
<p>I have a lvl 83 druid now with some very basic gear and it&rsquo;s fun to learn how to use the character optimally and finding my playstyle.</p>
<p>It is tempting to make another character because everybody is so collaborative, but perhaps it is best to just stick to one character.</p>
<h1 id="next-week">Next Week</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have an office day on Tuesday and I have many cluster upgrades planned at work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be meeting a friend from Norway for dinner on Saturday evening, looking forward to that.</p>
<p>Planning on strict OMAD all week and keeping up the running base training. Otherwise I&rsquo;m allowed to play Diablo 2 whenever I feel like it.</p>

      <description>Week 17 Reflection It has been a good week. Thursday was a public holiday: King&amp;rsquo;s Day. I spent it working on my new setup for making YouTube videos and doing a few chores. I let the festivities pass me by. I am more of a recluse. When I was younger I sometimes went to Amsterdam and joined the festivities. But now I derive no pleasure from large crowds of people consuming a lot of alcohol any longer.</description>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>It has been a good week. Thursday was a public holiday: King&rsquo;s Day. I spent it working on my new setup for making YouTube videos and doing a few chores. I let the festivities pass me by. I am more of a recluse. When I was younger I sometimes went to Amsterdam and joined the festivities. But now I derive no pleasure from large crowds of people consuming a lot of alcohol any longer.</p>
<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m making good progress on my current weight loss goal. Here are the results since I started my latest weight loss period:</p>
<h3 id="2023-04-16">2023-04-16</h3>
<p>Waist circumference: 83cm</p>
<p>78.6kg</p>
<p>17,5% Body Fat</p>
<h3 id="2023-04-23">2023-04-23</h3>
<p>82.3cm</p>
<p>78.2kg</p>
<p>16.9%</p>
<h3 id="2023-04-30">2023-04-30</h3>
<p>77.3kg</p>
<p>81cm</p>
<p>16,4%</p>
<p>The weight loss goal is currently taking up most of my head space. It takes a lot of effort to stay on track, fight off cravings and to consistently plan and weigh all of my food. However, 2 weeks into the regime, these actions are now slowly starting to become more habitual. Eventually this will become the new norm, and it will start happening automatically, costing less energy.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m very happy to see that I lost 1kg and 1cm from the waist.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I recently finished Can&rsquo;t Hurt Me by David Goggins which was very inspirational. Should write some notes on that soon.</p>
<p>Then I continued with Finding Ultra by Rich Roll. Enjoying it a lot so far.</p>
<p>I also started re-reading one of the best books on Buddhist practice in my opinion: <a href="https://www.forestdhamma.org/ebooks/english/pdf/Uncommon_Wisdom.pdf">Uncommon Wisdom</a> by Ajahn Pannavadho. I&rsquo;ve read this book 4 times already, but it is gold every single time.</p>
<p>I increased my meditation practice from 20 minutes to 40-90 minutes a day to help with food cravings and resting the mind. Ajahn Panna&rsquo;s emphasis on identifying discontentment and kilesas is a great aid in my practice currently.</p>
<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/OJ6n5wf84as">this video</a> a year ago and it (re-)kindled the desire to start running. I&rsquo;ve been watching it a few times for motivation and inspiration.</p>
<p>I also watched a few videos on Diablo 2 Resurrected to prepare for the upcoming ladder reset. I don&rsquo;t really have time to game, but the ladder reset is always a fun time because everybody is poor and there is a better community spirit going on. I decided to make a character and do a playthrough to wind down a bit from the weight loss efforts.</p>
<p>There have been many changes to the game and it is fun to catch up on Terror Zones and the new runewords, and the new builds they enable.</p>
<h3 id="listening">Listening</h3>
<p>I listened to <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-887-the-golden-rules-of-success/">The Golden Rules of Success</a>, but not much to take away from there.</p>
<p>Otherwise I&rsquo;m in a Dhamma phase, with increased meditation, so I&rsquo;ve only been listening to Ajahn Amaro&rsquo;s daily reflections and the most recent talks by Ajahn Sumedho.</p>
