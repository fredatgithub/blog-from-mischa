      <description>Week 21 My Week This week was a bit busier with two planned office days. Had an insightful conversation about my pension and future financial situation which made me think about whether I should consider purchasing property or keep renting.
Had a fun pizza workshop at work where we made original Napolitan pizza. They also offered a &amp;ldquo;Pizza Marinara&amp;rdquo; option which only used tomato sauce, oregano and olive oil. Perfect for plant-based me, and it was delicious!</description>

<p>This week was a bit busier with two planned office days. Had an insightful conversation about my pension and future financial situation which made me think about whether I should consider purchasing property or keep renting.</p>
<p>Had a fun pizza workshop at work where we made original Napolitan pizza. They also offered a &ldquo;Pizza Marinara&rdquo; option which only used tomato sauce, oregano and olive oil. Perfect for plant-based me, and it was delicious!</p>
<p>Another adventure happened. Recently I&rsquo;ve been following Samurai Matcha on YouTube and I became very inspired by his content. I saw that he was making a trip through Europe, and I invited him to stay with me if he was in the neighborhood. To my great surprise he emailed me the next day!</p>
<p>He stayed with me and we had a great time together. He performed a tea ceremony with delicious matcha tea for me, and we visited the Japanese Fair in Leiden together. Good times!</p>
<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>I discovered MAF training and it has been a gamechanger! My buddy Patriek nudged me in the right direction by commenting on my relatively low heart rate during training, and I started researching more.</p>

      <description>Week 20 My Week It was a nice week. I had an extra day off on Asenscion day and I decided to go for a camping trip for the first time after I moved back to the Netherlands.
It was a great experience, and I wrote a couple of Tumblr posts with photos:

<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>Went on a 12km hike on my camping trip.</p>
<p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/367c8cf46a5fdb8da612cff940e0a518/14d791b71c6209c9-fa/s1280x1920/e9c218d15016a7ac6eaa7397e14510db581c0016.jpg" alt=""  /></p>
<p>But I also managed to get my 5 runs in. One of them on Sunday morning, in the woods on my camping trip. It is going well and I am progressing nicely with my base building. Weekly distance increased with 0.5km.</p>
<h1 id="week-20---5">Week 20 - 5</h1>
<ul>
<li>Easy Run 1 Tue 44min</li>
<li>Easy Run 2 Wed 55min</li>
<li>Easy Run 3 Thu 47min</li>
<li>Easy Run 4 Sun 42min</li>
<li>Long Run   Fri 86min</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Total distance: 32,8km</li>
</ul>
<p>Weight loss is also progressing well. I missed a couple of weigh-ins because of the camping trip so I don&rsquo;t have a reliable weekly average. But on Monday I weighed 75.5kg, due to a lot of lost water weight from the trip. This is the first time I see the 75 on the scale, after being on a 76kg plateau for more than 6 months, so it was a big moment. But since it was water weight, I bumped back to 76.6kg the next day, which is still a good progression from last week.</p>

      <description>Week 19 It has been a good week. Very busy at work with AKS cluster maintenance, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working some evenings.
On Saturday I had a lovely dinner with a good friend from Norway who was passing through Amsterdam on his way back to Oslo from a trip to France.
Recently I started planning my holiday to Norway, and this has awakened the outdoorsman in me again. In my 9 years in Norway I became a seasoned traveler of mountains and forests, often staying out for weeks, but after I moved back to the Netherlands and focused on changing my career to IT, this outdoorsman has lain dormant.</description>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m going through all my gear again and purchasing some missing pieces, because I donated some gear when I left Norway. Planning to do camping trips in the Netherlands as well!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be <a href="/zet/started-using-tumblr/">logging these trips on Tumblr.</a></p>
<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>After last week&rsquo;s plateau I increased the strictness of my protocols. I was very strict with counting calories this week and kept strictly to One Meal A Day, and it has had good effects. I lost 0,64kg this week and my average weight is 76,91 now. My goal is 75kg for this weight loss bout.</p>

<p>Came across this reddit post:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/13a20pi/seneca_knew/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/13a20pi/seneca_knew/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=3</a></p>
<p>This rekindled my interest in Stoicism. I&rsquo;ve always been charmed by the Stoic philosophy and I implemented many elements of it in my own spiritual practice, consciously and unconsciously. But I now feel like taking a bit more structured approach towards an exploration of Stoicism. I&rsquo;m particularly interested in seeing how it overlaps with my Buddhist practice.</p>
<p>The Daily Stoic website has been on my radar for a while, but I did some reading this week and it seems like a great resource. I signed up for the daily email:</p>
<p><a href="https://dailystoic.com/dailyemail">https://dailystoic.com/dailyemail</a></p>
<p>I started reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.</p>
<h4 id="daily-stoic">Daily Stoic</h4>
<p>The Daily Stoic emails have been very informative and provided an excellent reading list.</p>
<p>Introduction to Stoicism:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brief synopsis on this particular school of
Hellenistic philosophy: Stoicism was founded in Athens
by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC, but
was famously practiced by the likes of Epictetus, Cato,
Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. The philosophy asserts
that virtue (such as wisdom) is happiness and judgment
should be based on behavior, rather than words. That
we don’t control and cannot rely on external events,
only ourselves and our responses.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="other">Other</h4>
<p>Voluntary poverty:</p>

<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>An interesting video series about the Fjallraven brand:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/4mSsYK7pAow">https://youtu.be/4mSsYK7pAow</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of Norrona, but I&rsquo;m falling head over heels in love with Fjallraven. I love the fact that they create products to last for generations. There are many instances of grandchildren inheriting pieces of gear from their grandfathers and continuing to use them.</p>

<p>Ajahn Amaro&rsquo;s reading of &ldquo;Being Dharma&rdquo; fro Ajahn Chah</p>

      <description>Week 18 My Week It has been a pretty good week. Rather busy at work with some unforeseen trouble for our production patching windows, which required rescheduling everything. Managed to clean up 2800 lines of code 🧹
Went to see Sabaton and had a great time.
Otherwise I&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing for the Diablo 2 Ladder Reset and played from Friday afternoon.

<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>My weight loss plateaued this week. I had two days where I overate, and I didn&rsquo;t do any 5:2 fasting this week. I&rsquo;m adjusting my daily calories downward to 1600 calories a day, eating only one meal a day.</p>
<p>Before I sometimes had a smaller meal at 16:00 to tide me over to dinner and to increase the protein consumption. But now I&rsquo;m sticking to strict OMAD (One Meal A Day).</p>
<p>I did keep up my exercise routine. The base building is going well, I set a new record by running 67 minutes today, and I didn&rsquo;t have any knee pain. I went for two strength workouts as well.</p>

      <description>Week 17 Reflection It has been a good week. Thursday was a public holiday: King&amp;rsquo;s Day. I spent it working on my new setup for making YouTube videos and doing a few chores. I let the festivities pass me by. I am more of a recluse. When I was younger I sometimes went to Amsterdam and joined the festivities. But now I derive no pleasure from large crowds of people consuming a lot of alcohol any longer.</description>

<p>It has been a good week. Thursday was a public holiday: King&rsquo;s Day. I spent it working on my new setup for making YouTube videos and doing a few chores. I let the festivities pass me by. I am more of a recluse. When I was younger I sometimes went to Amsterdam and joined the festivities. But now I derive no pleasure from large crowds of people consuming a lot of alcohol any longer.</p>
<h2 id="exercise--weight-loss">Exercise &amp; Weight Loss</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m making good progress on my current weight loss goal. Here are the results since I started my latest weight loss period:</p>
<h3 id="2023-04-16">2023-04-16</h3>
<p>Waist circumference: 83cm</p>
<p>78.6kg</p>
<p>17,5% Body Fat</p>
<h3 id="2023-04-23">2023-04-23</h3>
<p>82.3cm</p>
<p>78.2kg</p>
<p>16.9%</p>
<h3 id="2023-04-30">2023-04-30</h3>
<p>77.3kg</p>
<p>81cm</p>
<p>16,4%</p>
<p>The weight loss goal is currently taking up most of my head space. It takes a lot of effort to stay on track, fight off cravings and to consistently plan and weigh all of my food. However, 2 weeks into the regime, these actions are now slowly starting to become more habitual. Eventually this will become the new norm, and it will start happening automatically, costing less energy.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m very happy to see that I lost 1kg and 1cm from the waist.</p>
<h3 id="running">Running</h3>
<p>I completed week 2 of my base building schedule, and I&rsquo;m making progress.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I recently finished Can&rsquo;t Hurt Me by David Goggins which was very inspirational. Should write some notes on that soon.</p>
<p>Then I continued with Finding Ultra by Rich Roll. Enjoying it a lot so far.</p>
<p>I also started re-reading one of the best books on Buddhist practice in my opinion: <a href="https://www.forestdhamma.org/ebooks/english/pdf/Uncommon_Wisdom.pdf">Uncommon Wisdom</a> by Ajahn Pannavadho. I&rsquo;ve read this book 4 times already, but it is gold every single time.</p>
<p>I increased my meditation practice from 20 minutes to 40-90 minutes a day to help with food cravings and resting the mind. Ajahn Panna&rsquo;s emphasis on identifying discontentment and kilesas is a great aid in my practice currently.</p>
<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/OJ6n5wf84as">this video</a> a year ago and it (re-)kindled the desire to start running. I&rsquo;ve been watching it a few times for motivation and inspiration.</p>
<p>I also watched a few videos on Diablo 2 Resurrected to prepare for the upcoming ladder reset. I don&rsquo;t really have time to game, but the ladder reset is always a fun time because everybody is poor and there is a better community spirit going on. I decided to make a character and do a playthrough to wind down a bit from the weight loss efforts.</p>
<p>There have been many changes to the game and it is fun to catch up on Terror Zones and the new runewords, and the new builds they enable.</p>
<h3 id="listening">Listening</h3>
<p>I listened to <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-887-the-golden-rules-of-success/">The Golden Rules of Success</a>, but not much to take away from there.</p>
<p>Otherwise I&rsquo;m in a Dhamma phase, with increased meditation, so I&rsquo;ve only been listening to Ajahn Amaro&rsquo;s daily reflections and the most recent talks by Ajahn Sumedho.</p>
