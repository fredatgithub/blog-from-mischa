      <description>Every day I make a big smoothie of lots of leafy greens, fruits, vegetables, and other ingredients such as flax seeds, turmeric, cinnamon and ginger. I wondered how blending these ingredients affects the dietary fibre and did some research.
Blending fruits and vegetables can affect their dietary fiber content, but not necessarily in a bad way. Dietary fiber is the part of plant foods that our bodies cannot digest. It helps us feel full, regulate our blood sugar, lower our cholesterol, and prevent constipation.</description>

<p>Blending fruits and vegetables can affect their dietary fiber content, but not necessarily in a bad way. Dietary fiber is the part of plant foods that our bodies cannot digest. It helps us feel full, regulate our blood sugar, lower our cholesterol, and prevent constipation. There are two types of dietary fiber: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance in our intestines. It slows down digestion and absorption of glucose and cholesterol. Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water and adds bulk to our stool. It speeds up the passage of food and waste through our digestive system.</p>
<p>When you blend fruits and vegetables, you break down the cell walls of the plant cells, which contain insoluble fiber. This makes the fiber more accessible to our digestive enzymes and bacteria, which can ferment it and produce gas. It also reduces the volume and weight of the food, which may make you feel less full. However, blending does not destroy the fiber completely. It just changes its form and function. You still get the benefits of soluble fiber, which can lower your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. You also get more nutrients from the fruits and vegetables, as blending makes them easier to digest and absorb.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that blending fruits and vegetables does not destroy their fiber, but it does alter it. You may lose some of the benefits of insoluble fiber, such as feeling full and preventing constipation, but you may gain some of the benefits of soluble fiber, such as lowering your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. You also get more vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals from the blended foods. The best way to get enough fiber is to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, both whole and blended, as well as other sources of fiber such as whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds.</p>
