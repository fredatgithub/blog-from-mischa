      <description>A super inspiring podcast with Mike Fremont who ran marathons well into his nineties on a plant-based diet and who raced the National Canoe Championships at age 99. He adopted a plant based diet after being diagnosed with colon cancer at age 69. Although the cancer had metastasized and spread to other parts of his body, he received an operation and the cancer was cured. He only became competitive in running when he was well into his eighties.</description>

<p>A super inspiring podcast with Mike Fremont who ran marathons well into his nineties on a plant-based diet and who raced the National Canoe Championships at age 99. He adopted a plant based diet after being diagnosed with colon cancer at age 69. Although the cancer had metastasized and spread to other parts of his body, he received an operation and the cancer was cured. He only became competitive in running when he was well into his eighties.</p>
<p>I find his story hugely inspiring and motivating to keep focussing on my health, never make any compromises on my diet and to keep running.</p>
<p>When asked about the most important things in life, he said that helping other people in any way you can is the only thing that brings real rewards and satisfaction. It&rsquo;s not the money.</p>

      <title>How Does Blending Fruits And Vegetables Affect Their Fibre Content?</title>

      <description>Every day I make a big smoothie of lots of leafy greens, fruits, vegetables, and other ingredients such as flax seeds, turmeric, cinnamon and ginger. I wondered how blending these ingredients affects the dietary fibre and did some research.
Blending fruits and vegetables can affect their dietary fiber content, but not necessarily in a bad way. Dietary fiber is the part of plant foods that our bodies cannot digest. It helps us feel full, regulate our blood sugar, lower our cholesterol, and prevent constipation.</description>

<p>Blending fruits and vegetables can affect their dietary fiber content, but not necessarily in a bad way. Dietary fiber is the part of plant foods that our bodies cannot digest. It helps us feel full, regulate our blood sugar, lower our cholesterol, and prevent constipation. There are two types of dietary fiber: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance in our intestines. It slows down digestion and absorption of glucose and cholesterol. Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water and adds bulk to our stool. It speeds up the passage of food and waste through our digestive system.</p>
<p>When you blend fruits and vegetables, you break down the cell walls of the plant cells, which contain insoluble fiber. This makes the fiber more accessible to our digestive enzymes and bacteria, which can ferment it and produce gas. It also reduces the volume and weight of the food, which may make you feel less full. However, blending does not destroy the fiber completely. It just changes its form and function. You still get the benefits of soluble fiber, which can lower your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. You also get more nutrients from the fruits and vegetables, as blending makes them easier to digest and absorb.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that blending fruits and vegetables does not destroy their fiber, but it does alter it. You may lose some of the benefits of insoluble fiber, such as feeling full and preventing constipation, but you may gain some of the benefits of soluble fiber, such as lowering your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. You also get more vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals from the blended foods. The best way to get enough fiber is to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, both whole and blended, as well as other sources of fiber such as whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds.</p>
