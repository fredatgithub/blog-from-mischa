	<span style="color: #ffffff">18 September 2022</span><br>
	<br>
	If you are just starting your Linux journey, you might have noticed that a few camps exist in the Linux world. Just like in any other area of life, it seems that groups of human beings enjoy dividing themselves instead of living in harmony.

	<span style="color: #ffffff">10 September 2022</span><br>
	<br>
	NOTE: In this article, I use a rather broad definition of “Operating System.” I do not intend to appear as if I wrote and compiled my own Linux kernel, nor do I understand the inner workings of the kernel written in C.

	<span style="color: #ffffff">26 May 2022</span><br>
	<br>
	I have installed my OS on a 240GB SSD, and I prefer to keep my data on a different disk to leave enough space to work with. I wanted to move my steam game files to a separate hard drive on Linux.

	<span style="color: #ffffff">26 April 2022</span><br>
	<br>
	After getting my LPIC-1 certification, my interest in Linux continued to grow. When I started my new job, I performed more sysadmin tasks, such as increasing the size of filesystems or removing backups, and it felt good to put the theory into practice.

	<span style="color: #ffffff">02 April 2022</span><br>
	<br>
	This week I learned about yadm: yet another dotfile manager. It is the perfect way to keep track of all your custom configuration files, known as dotfiles.
Even if you have only a little bit of experience with Linux, you know that everything is managed in files.

	<span style="color: #ffffff">16 March 2022</span><br>
	<br>
	I recently obtained my LPIC-1 certification, and in this blog post, I’ll share the strategy and techniques I used to pass this exam and share my thoughts on the certification. Because I am a Linux novice, the exam was a pretty tough grind for me.
