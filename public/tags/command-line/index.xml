      <title>Adding Articles to Wallabag From Qutebrowser</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been daily driving Qutebrowser for over a month now, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel at home in it.
Since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any extensions, you have to hack things together yourself, which is why I like it so much.
Today I wanted to add an article to my Wallabag instance, which I usually did by using the browser extension.
I installed this Wallabag CLI:
https://github.com/artur-shaik/wallabag-client
pipx install wallabag-client
After setting up the config I can now add entries from the command line.</description>

<p>Since it doesn&rsquo;t have any extensions, you have to hack things together yourself, which is why I like it so much.</p>
<p>Today I wanted to add an article to my Wallabag instance, which I usually did by using the browser extension.</p>
<p>I installed this Wallabag CLI:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/artur-shaik/wallabag-client">https://github.com/artur-shaik/wallabag-client</a></p>
<p><code>pipx install wallabag-client</code></p>
<p>After setting up the config I can now add entries from the command line. By running <code>wallabag add [url]</code>. Neat!</p>
<p>Next, we can use the <code>spawn</code> command from within Qutebrowser to call this CLI command:</p>
<p><code>spawn -v -m wallabag add {url}</code></p>
<h2 id="alias">Alias</h2>
<p>And to make it easier, I added a <code>:wallabag</code> alias by adding this to my <code>config.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">aliases</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="s1">&#39;wallabag&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;spawn -v -m wallabag add </span><span class="si">{url}</span><span class="s1">&#39;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now I can just run <code>:wallabag</code> from within Qutebrowser and it will add the article.</p>
<h2 id="build-it-yourself">Build It Yourself</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m really starting to love Qutebrowser for much of the same reasons why I love (neo)vim so much. I can call CLI commands from within my editor (or browser) and interact with my system that way.</p>
<p>Since you can do almost anything from the CLI, you can build some very powerful workflows this way.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;m going to do the same for my Linkding instance so I can add bookmarks from within Qutebrowser.</p>
<p>Feels nice that I don&rsquo;t need any extensions for this!</p>

      <title>No More GitHub - My Updated Backup Setup For My Obsidian Zettelkasten</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/my-updated-backup-setup-for-my-obsidian-zetelkasten/</link>

      <description>I relied on iCloud sync for my Obsidian backup for many years. However, my vault has grown significantly and has reached nearly 3500 notes. This leads to problems when opening the vault on other iOs devices, because iCloud sync removes files from devices when they are not used. When the vault is reopened, it takes over 5 minutes to sync everything. Having this 5 minute waiting time every time I open up my vault on my iPad was a problem which I needed to address.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I relied on iCloud sync for my Obsidian backup for many years. However, my vault has grown significantly and has reached nearly 3500 notes. This leads to problems when opening the vault on other iOs devices, because iCloud sync removes files from devices when they are not used. When the vault is reopened, it takes over 5 minutes to sync everything. Having this 5 minute waiting time every time I open up my vault on my iPad was a problem which I needed to address.</p>
<p>These small frictions can become large irritations, even though I only use Obsidian on my iPad very occasionally.</p>
<p>To alleviate this problem I switched to Obsidian Sync. It&rsquo;s 4 dollars a month, and a great way to support the project. I&rsquo;ve had Sync before, but switched to iCloud when I entered the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="git">Git</h2>
<p>In addition to iCloud and Obsidian Sync, I&rsquo;ve also been backing up my vault to GitHub. I used this to sync my vault to Linux devices before I purchased Obsidian Sync again.</p>
<p>Syncing with Git has often led to problems. I&rsquo;ve spent many hours reverting faulty commits where I was about to lose a bunch of data.</p>
<p>Another glaring problem is that I&rsquo;m committing my entire web of knowledge, my deepest thoughts and reflections and personal information to GitHub. Even though it is in a private repository, it&rsquo;s likely that Microsoft can access it some way or other if they want to. I haven&rsquo;t researched it thoroughly, but using a free service like GitHub usually comes with privacy sacrifices.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mind it that much, but it was something that was gnawing on the back of my mind for years.</p>
<p>Today I pulled the plug on it. It felt strange to delete the repo, but it&rsquo;s gone now.</p>
<h2 id="rsync--icloud">Rsync + iCloud</h2>
<p>My notes are safely backed up using Obsidian Sync. It&rsquo;s all encrypted at rest and in transfer. But I also want to have my own backups.</p>
<p>To be absolutely safe I&rsquo;m also backing up the vault to my iCloud drive.</p>
<p>Yeah, now I&rsquo;m giving Apple potential access to my files. But I think my data is safer with Apple than with GitHub where it can probably be used for training AI models.</p>
<p>The next step will be to back it up to my Synology NAS, but I&rsquo;m running into some problems with mounting the SMB share from the command line, so I&rsquo;ll save that for later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the following script to back up my Zettelkasten to my iCloud drive. It runs twice a day using a cron job on my MacBook Pro.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="cp">#!/bin/bash

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Backup and commit completed successfully!&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="keeping-git">Keeping Git</h2>
<p>As you can see, I&rsquo;m still committing changes every time I back up. I&rsquo;m keeping it as a local Git repo so I can revert commits when something unexpected happens.</p>
<p>If push comes to shove, I can always push (😏) it to a Git instance again, or even to GitHub.</p>
<p>I considered running my private Git instance in my homelab cluster, but I also don&rsquo;t want my Zettelkasten to be available there in case someone manages to break into my cluster. Even though I&rsquo;m running enterprise grade security with Talos, there is always a risk because I&rsquo;m exposing some services to the internet.</p>

      <title>The Return of Arch Linux</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/the-return-of-arch-linux/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m planning to do a series on Linux on my YouTube channel. The idea is to cover the fundamentals of Linux, either by teaching them myself or to link to existing resources. When the basics are done, I will take over and we&amp;rsquo;ll build an Arch Linux desktop together.
I use my MacBook for normal productive work and coding, and I have a Thinkpad T480 which I have for experimentation, and mostly for writing notes and browsing while I&amp;rsquo;m in the living room.</description>

The idea is to cover the fundamentals of Linux, either by teaching them myself or to link to existing resources. When the basics are done, I will take over and we&rsquo;ll build an Arch Linux desktop together.</p>
<p>I use my MacBook for normal productive work and coding, and I have a Thinkpad T480 which I have for experimentation, and mostly for writing notes and browsing while I&rsquo;m in the living room. It was running Fedora using the Sway spin, and it worked fine.</p>
<p>But Arch Linux has been gnawing at me ever since I started my community. We&rsquo;ve had some lovely discussions about distros and window managers, and I almost always commented that I enjoyed building my Arch Linux system.</p>
<p>Well, I went back to it!</p>
<p>This time I&rsquo;m going even more minimal. I took the challenge of not using NetworkManager, and I figured I would go with systemd-boot right away too.</p>
<p>Some of you might remember the problems that happened with GRUB about 2 years ago. Systemd-boot feels so much more intuitive and straightforward to configure.</p>
<p>So now I have a super clean and minimal system using system-boot and systemd-networkd with iwd.</p>
<p>Getting internet to work was a bit of a challenge but figured it out eventually.</p>
<p>Using systemd-resolved, I currently don&rsquo;t even have a /etc/hosts file on my Arch Linux system. That&rsquo;s a new one for me.</p>
<p>This is the current pstree while ssh&rsquo;d into my Thinkpad from the MacBook.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy with the current minimal state of it!</p>

      <description>Although I rarely use Obsidian anymore, I still have it open because it is running the obsidian-git plugin in the background and it is constantly backing up my second brain to GitHub.
I use iCloud to synch my vault across my iOs devices and I always create and edit my files using neovim.
For my new gig at work I&amp;rsquo;m forced to use a windows laptop which means I cannot use iCloud to synch my vault.</description>

curl wttr.in
This will show the weather based on your location, but you can also give a particular location and format.
curl wttr.in/Amsterdam

      <title>How to Run Newsboat in Zenmode</title>

      <description>To read the news free from distractions and ads I use Newsboat as a reader for RSS feeds.
However, one thing that annoyed me was that it would span across my entire screen in the terminal. When you read blogs or news pages in the browser, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that the text is always located in a middle column of the window, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to move your neck while reading.</description>

<p>However, one thing that annoyed me was that it would span across my entire screen in the terminal. When you read blogs or news pages in the browser, you&rsquo;ll notice that the text is always located in a middle column of the window, so you don&rsquo;t have to move your neck while reading. At least, this is the case with well designed websites that serve text content.</p>
<p>Vim has a plugin that achieves this and I use it extensively. It is called Zenmode. In Neovim I use a similar plugin called No Neckpain.</p>
<p>To achieve a similar configuration for Newsboat I used tmux. I wrote the following bash script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># nb opens a new pane and runs newsboat in it. I want to read from a centered column in my screen.</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">tmux split-pane -h <span class="se">\;</span> resize-pane -x 130<span class="se">\;</span> send -t <span class="m">2</span> <span class="s2">&#34;newsboat&#34;</span> Enter<span class="se">\;</span> send -t <span class="m">1</span> <span class="s2">&#34;clear&#34;</span> Enter
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that this needs to be run from within an existing tmux window with no split panes.</p>
<p>It splits the current window in to two panes, resizes the new pane to a width of 130 pixels and sends the &ldquo;newsboat&rdquo; command to the new pane, and the &ldquo;clear&rdquo; command to the old (left) pane to keep it nice and clean.</p>
<p>In my <code>~/.newsboat/config</code> file I added the following setting:</p>
<p><code>text-width 72</code></p>
<p>This will limit the text on the right hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>The end result looks like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/newsboat-zen.png" type="" alt="Newsboat Zenmode"  /></p>
