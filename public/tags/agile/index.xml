      <description>When learning a programming language it is important to start building things quickly and to begin applying the theory. I have a tendency to dive into the books and lose myself in the theory, where I should be getting hands on experience.
Over the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve generated a bunch of ideas for projects that I want to write, and I selected my first project today.
Twitter CLI Programs should solve a problem.</description>

<p>Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve generated a bunch of ideas for projects that I want to write, and I selected my first project today.</p>
<h1 id="twitter-cli">Twitter CLI</h1>
<p>Programs should solve a problem. My problem has to do with Twitter. I recently created a Twitter account, and I want to make a tweet whenever I publish something new on my website. I&rsquo;m currently doing this by hand, and that needs to stop, obviously.</p>
<p>There are bots out there for this, but I want to build it myself. I&rsquo;ve created the following user stories for my project.</p>
<h2 id="user-story-1">User Story 1</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As a user, I need a command that I can run from a bash shell that will post the standard input to my Twitter account</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="user-story-2">User Story 2</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As a user, I need a command that I can run from a bash shell that will take the latest post from the RSS feed generated by my blog and post it to Twitter</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<p>By writing this program I&rsquo;ll need to figure out the following problems in Go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking input from the command line</li>
<li>Authenticating to the Twitter API</li>
<li>Making a POST request to the Twitter API</li>
<li>Curling an RSS feed</li>
<li>Looping over / reading XML / HTML data</li>
<li>Transforming that data to a suitable format to post to Twitter</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="expansion">Expansion</h1>
<p>This will be a good start for my project and will keep me busy for a while. When I solved the previous problems I can use the result and expand further. Some thoughts about further expansion:</p>
<h2 id="rss-feeds">RSS Feeds</h2>
<p>I can use the skills I learn to start crawling Reddit feeds and filter them for keywords. I can automatically generate a curated selection from Reddit which will be easier to consume and will save me time by only serving me content that I might think is interesting to me, based on keywords.</p>
<h2 id="database">Database</h2>
<p>I want to learn more about using databases on Kubernetes and how to interact with databases using Go. For this I&rsquo;d like to store my RSS feed into a database and keep track of information in the database. I could track whether an article has been posted to Twitter and when.</p>
<h2 id="bot">Bot</h2>
<p>Rather than posting my latest blog post to Twitter by manually running a command, I should have a bot scanning my blog and posting to Twitter when it detects a new article. Or I could trigger the bot whenever I make a push to my blog repo.</p>
<p>In any case, I want to have an application running on a server. I&rsquo;m making plans to start up a proper home lab and this will be a perfect use case to start running on my home Kubernetes cluster.</p>
