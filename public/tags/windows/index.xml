      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ran into a problem when cloning my second brain repository on a new windows machine which I need to use for work. Also trying to get familiar with VSCode although I&amp;rsquo;m doing my best to get a good WSL setup going on my new windows setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem I was running into was that I could not for the life of me clone my repository at all on Windows. Eventually I realized that it kept failing on a file that had a question mark in its filename.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>One problem I was running into was that I could not for the life of me clone my repository at all on Windows. Eventually I realized that it kept failing on a file that had a question mark in its filename.</p>
<p>I renamed all the files that had invalid characters.</p>
<p>It also failed because apparently I had a file in the repo named &ldquo;&quot;. It didn&rsquo;t like that at all.</p>
<p>After changing the filenames it worked.</p>
<p>It is good to keep my second brain compatible with all operating systems so this is actually a good practice session.</p>

      <title>It is good to keep your second brain compatible with Obsidian</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I rarely use Obsidian anymore, I still have it open because it is running the obsidian-git plugin in the background and it is constantly backing up my second brain to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use iCloud to synch my vault across my iOs devices and I always create and edit my files using neovim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my new gig at work I&amp;rsquo;m forced to use a windows laptop which means I cannot use iCloud to synch my vault. Then it is a godsend to be able to install Obsidian and use that to interact with my second brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>For my new gig at work I&rsquo;m forced to use a windows laptop which means I cannot use iCloud to synch my vault. Then it is a godsend to be able to install Obsidian and use that to interact with my second brain.</p>
<p>It is very good to keep it compatible with obsidian so I can use the software for synching and interacting with my second brain on other operating systems conveniently.</p>
