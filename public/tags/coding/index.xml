      <title>Back to Bas(h)ics: leaving zsh for now</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used zsh for nearly two years now. I have a custom setup with autocompletion and a good looking prompt.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been diving deeper into bash scripting, following tutorials by rwxrob. He emphasizes all the time that it is much better to stick to bash instead of zsh.
Advantages of using bash:
the default Linux shell available on any Linux system full documentation available anywhere at all times with man bash free software less dependent on external plugins and configurations more portable practice by working on the command line The fact that working on the commandline is already coding convinced me to leave my beloved customized prompt behind (for now) and go back to the basics.</description>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been diving deeper into bash scripting, following tutorials by rwxrob. He emphasizes all the time that it is much better to stick to bash instead of zsh.</p>
<p>Advantages of using bash:</p>
<ul>
<li>the default Linux shell</li>
<li>available on any Linux system</li>
<li>full documentation available anywhere at all times with <code>man bash</code></li>
<li>free software</li>
<li>less dependent on external plugins and configurations</li>
<li>more portable</li>
<li>practice by working on the command line</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that <a href="/content/zet/bash-cmdline-is-coding.md">working on the commandline is already coding</a> convinced me to leave my beloved customized prompt behind (for now) and go back to the basics.</p>
<p>I want to improve my bash scripting, and working in the bash shell will improve that just by virtue of doing my daily tasks on the command line.</p>
<p>Also I noticed I&rsquo;ve gotten used to zsh&rsquo;s excellent autocompletion and menu navigation. When I log in to servers at work, there is always this little moment of &ldquo;oh, I don&rsquo;t have that here&rdquo;. I want to get better at bash so I&rsquo;m not dependent on these external crutches anymore.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m going to port my zsh configuration to bash. My current zsh configuration loads a bunch of plugins, and it is more of a hassle to get set up on a new system.</p>
<p>I want to be able to pull my dotfiles repo and do very few steps to configure my environment.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to miss that good-looking prompt with all the lovely icons!</p>

      <description>Rob Muhlenstein makes an interesting point that using bash on the command line is already coding. When you are running commands in the terminal, you are coding one line at a time.
When you put these commands in a file you have a bash script. Therefore, he argues that bash should be your first language.
I think this is such an interesting point. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Linux and working on the command line for years but it never dawned on me that I, in fact, was coding while working on the command line.</description>

<p>I think this is such an interesting point. I&rsquo;ve been using Linux and working on the command line for years but it never dawned on me that I, in fact, was coding while working on the command line. However, when I was writing bash scripts, I did consider myself to be coding. There is literally no difference. A bash script is just a string of commands that you would enter manually anyway.</p>

      <description>A software development kit (SDK) is a set of tools provided by the manufacturer of (usually) a hardware platform, operating system (OS), or programming language.
SDKs contain all the tools you need to get started. They typically contain a compiler, a debugger and an API. But they can also contain documentation and testing tools.</description>

      <description>When you call a function, the system sets aside space in memory for the function to do its work. Those chunks are called &amp;ldquo;stack frames&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;function frames.&amp;rdquo;
These frames are arranged in a stack. The frame for the most recently called function is always at the top of the stack. When a new function is called, it becomes the active frame, and it is on top of the stack.</description>

<p>These frames are arranged in a stack. The frame for the most recently called function is always at the top of the stack. When a new function is called, it becomes the active frame, and it is on top of the stack.</p>
<p>The function that is actually doing something at the moment is on top of the stack and is known as the &ldquo;active frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the function finishes its work, the frame is popped off of the stack. The frame in second place becomes the active frame. It had been paused in the meantime, and now it is active again, because it is on top.</p>
<p>Functions that are not on top, are not running.</p>

      <title>Getting Started with Neovim: kickstart.nvim</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/kickstart-nvim/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using neovim for over a year now, and I&amp;rsquo;m very happy that I went through the initial difficulty of learning vim. One of the best perks of using neovim is that you can customize your entire editing experience and workflow. However, it can be a daunting experience to start with an empty configuration and set up everything from scratch.
I started with an empty vanilla vim config and slowly added the plugins as I went along.</description>

One of the best perks of using neovim is that you can customize your entire editing experience and workflow. However, it can be a daunting experience to start with an empty configuration and set up everything from scratch.</p>
<p>I started with an empty vanilla vim config and slowly added the plugins as I went along. Videos by content creators such as ThePrimagen were also helpful in getting inspiration on which plugins I might like for my setup. But this might not be suitable for everyone. I was only editing yaml files and writing simple Python scripts at the time, whereas you might be looking for an IDE experience out of the box.</p>
<p>Recently I discovered <a href="https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim">kickstart.nvim</a> by neovim core maintainer TJdeVries.</p>
<p>I decided to give it a try, and I was pleasantly surprised. It is a great starting setup for a beginner. It is simple and does not overwhelm you with thousands of features.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve completely rewritten my config based on kickstart.nvim, and I am delighted with the result. Especially the LSP setup is very well thought out, and it works much better than the setup I came up with on my own.</p>
<p>TJ DeVries also made a <a href="https://youtu.be/stqUbv-5u2s">video</a> introducing kickstart.nvim and going through the initial setup.</p>
<p>I highly recommend kickstart.nvim if you are interested in using neovim and are looking for a sane place to start.</p>

      <description>Two months ago I knew nothing about GitHub. This week my first pull request got merged into master!
Programming tutorials and books very often suggest that you should try to contribute to open source in order to practice your skills. Even though I am still on the beginner level in Python, I managed to find something I could contribute with. But there were a few things I needed to learn in order to be able to do so.</description>

<p>Programming tutorials and books very often suggest that you should try to contribute to open source in order to practice your skills. Even though I am still on the beginner level in Python, I managed to find something I could contribute with. But there were a few things I needed to learn in order to be able to do so.</p>
<p>GitHub is a place where many open source projects are hosted. Projects are hosted in “repositories” available to the public. Everyone can go in and take a look at the code. And the great thing about it is that everyone can contribute to the code as well.</p>
<p>Two months ago I knew almost nothing about GitHub. Surely, I had often downloaded software from GitHub, and I knew it had to do with version control. But I had no idea that it was such a powerful system of enabling collaboration for software projects.</p>
<p>During an assignment in my DevOps Traineeship I spent some time learning about Github and the Git language. I learned about repositories, branches, commits and pull requests. Now I wanted to take it to the next level and make a contribution of my own somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="the-project">the project</h3>
<p>As I have mentioned in other posts, I love game automation, and recently I discovered the Botty project, which is a bot written for the game Diablo 2: Resurrected. The bot is written in Python, which means that it is a great way of applying my Python learning to something I am passionate about.</p>
<p>The bot uses computer vision in order to recognise what is on the screen and run scripts accordingly. The monsters in the game drop items, and if you want the bot to pick up items, it will need to be taught which items it needs to pick up.</p>
<p>This is done by adding some images to its image database and adding the filenames to a list of items. When the bot scans the screen for items, it will look for a match in its image database, and when it matches, it will click the corresponding pixels on the screen to pick up the item.</p>
<p>Here’s what an image in the database looks like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/axe.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>I am doing a Holy Grail project in this game, which means that I am collecting every item in the game. It is quite an undertaking as there are 506 items in the game, and some items have a drop chance of 1 : 1.000.000. Luckily I have a bot to help me with this project.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, many items were still missing from the bot because it is a fairly new project that is still in development. And as I needed my bot to pick up the items I needed, I decided to add these 46 missing items to the database.</p>
<h3 id="forks-commits-and-pull-requests">forks, commits and pull requests</h3>
<p>After doing the work I still needed to figure out how I should offer these items to the project. Luckily someone shared a few very helpful tutorials in the project’s discord. This is the tutorial I used for my first contribution:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/">Step-by-step Guide to Contributing on Github</a></p>
<p>You begin with “forking” the project repository, which basically means making your own copy of all the code in the project. Then you add your contribution to the fork by cloning it to your local machine and making your changes to a new branch.</p>
<p>When you have committed your changes and pushed your new branch to your fork, you are ready to make your first pull request. A pull request is a way of telling the project that you have something to contribute. You are sharing your version of the project repository including your proposed changes, and someone from the project will take a look at your suggestions and see if they are useful and compatible.</p>
<h3 id="merged-into-master">merged into master</h3>
<p>After a few days someone had a look at my contribution and requested me to make a few small adjustments. When I managed to incorporate those my contribution was accepted, and my changes were “merged into master”, which means that my contribution was brought into the main version of the project’s code.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/merged.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<h3 id="i-learned-a-lot">I learned a lot!</h3>
<p>As I am typing out this article, I am very satisfied with how much I have learned in the past few months already. I remember being very confused about all the GitHub terminology when I attended my first meetings during my DevOps traineeship.</p>
<p>Going through the process of making a contribution to open source on GitHub has been an enriching experience. It seemed quite intimidating at the start, but by following a good tutorial I managed to successfully submit my first pull request. I feel I have a much better understanding of Git, GitHub and the workflow.</p>
<p>Another valuable lesson I learned is that you don’t need to be a Senior Engineer in order to be able to contribute to open source. Although this project is written in Python, my contribution had very little to do with code, but I provided assets which were required by the code. So if you are a beginner at programming, you can look for other ways to contribute, such as fixing spelling mistakes in the documentation, providing images or writing wiki pages.</p>

      <title>My Mirst Useful Python Script</title>

      <description>The best part of learning Python is trying to identify things in my life which I can automate by writing a script. Learning a programming language involves doing a lot of exercises that sometimes lack a connection with the real world. But after I decided to go for it, I am always on the lookout for projects. Not only for my job as a DevOps Engineer, but also for my private life.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best part of learning Python is trying to identify things in my life which I can automate by writing a script. Learning a programming language involves doing a lot of exercises that sometimes lack a connection with the real world. But after I decided to go for it, I am always on the lookout for projects. Not only for my job as a DevOps Engineer, but also for my private life. In this case, I needed to write a program that parses log files from a bot so I could get a total number of runs. You can have a look at the final result in my Diablo 2 <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/diablo2">GitHub repo. </a></p>
<p>Like I wrote in my <a href="https://mischavandenburg.com/my-journey-into-devops-so-far/">journey into DevOps article</a>, I love automating games. Diablo 2 is a game that was originally released in 2002 and which recently was remastered. Diablo 2 always had a very strong presence of bots in the online game, and it didn’t take long before I also joined the ride.</p>
<p>A few months after the remaster the first bots have started emerging as well. There is a a particularly good one written in Python which is an <a href="https://github.com/aeon0/botty">open source project</a>, which is a perfect opportunity for me to learn more about Python by trying to understand its code and solving problems. I was very excited to discover it because I was playing quite a few hours a week. Diablo 2 is a very grindy game and it takes a lot of time to find the needed gear. Now I could finally outsource my grinding to the computer again.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">the problem</h2>
<p>Although the bot is very functional and does several tasks very well, there are still features missing because it is relatively early in its development. One of these features is keeping track of the total amount of runs that the bot has done. In Diablo, every time you play you start a “game” or an instance. In that game there are certain bosses you can kill, and when you are finished you exit your game. This is called a run. Then you create a new game and everything is reset, and you get another shot at killing the bosses to get the precious gear.</p>
<p>Being the nerd that I am, I like to keep track of the total amount of runs that the bot has done. On these numbers I like to apply some calculations to see how many items I get per xxxx runs and suchlike. The bot keeps track of the amount of runs it does per session and stores them in a log file. But there is no functionality of seeing the total amount of runs you have done, and when I discovered this, I realised I had my first little Python project.</p>
<h2 id="log-files">log files</h2>
<p>Every time you close the bot after a session, a log file is created that looks like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/logfile.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>It is formatted as a .txt file and shows information about the bosses that were run and the items that were found. Most importantly, it contains the amount of games that were done in the session. Even after only using the bot for a short time I had over 100 log files to go through, and that’s where I needed a script that would go through these files for me and add the numbers in order to get the total amount of runs.</p>
<h2 id="the-script">the script</h2>
<p>After completing chapter 9 and 10 in the Automate the Boring Stuff book, I learned about file paths and opening files and reading from them. Now it was time to apply that knowledge. The process went pretty well and soon I had a script that would open the files for me.</p>
<p>Things got a little bit more complicated when I needed to read information from the files. And of course, this operation would almost certainly involve the dreaded topic of regex. In the end it was not as bad, and I ended up with the following regex:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">regex_games</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">r</span><span class="s2">&#34;Games:&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">regex_dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">&#39;nihla&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Nihl|Nihlatak&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">&#39;pindle&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Pin|Pindle&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s1">&#39;eldritch&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Eld&#39;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you will see afterwards, I needed a way to check every line for a certain statement. However, rather than hardcoding every operation, I wanted it to loop over a list of terms. This meant that I could easily go back to the code and add a few more search statements if I needed them. I ended up storing them in a dictionary as you can see above. I really like the way you can make dictionaries in Python and have every entry on a new line. It makes the code very readable and structured.</p>
<p>And this is the actual looping sequence that I ended up with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">folder_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sub_folder</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">file_names</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">walk</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">):</span>

When the file is opened it looks for the “Games: 25” line and adds the number to a variable. However, I was not only interested in the total number of games. I also wanted to get more insight in how many Pindle runs or Nihla runs I had done. So I set up another regex search and made sure that the number of games are added to a “pindle_total” or “nihla_total” variable.</p>
<h2 id="result">result</h2>
<p>When running the script in the shell, the result looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">mischa@MischaMacBook stats_parser % python3 total_runs.py

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">mischa@MischaMacBook stats_parser % 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Exactly what I wanted. Now I can just paste my stats files into a folder and see how many runs I’ve done. Maybe I’ll improve it by building a GUI. Another fun idea I have is to create a little pipeline where this script would be run once an hour and the stats would be uploaded to a webpage somewhere, so others could see the amount of runs of my bot. Not that anyone is interested in that, but it is a fun project for me to do. Let’s see what happens!</p>
<p>For now I am very happy with the result. It was a very satisfying experience to identify a problem that I had and to be able to come up with an automated solution. Of course it is still very rudimentary programming, and there is a long long way ahead of me, but it was fun to finally do something practical that solved a particular problem in my life.</p>

      <description>I am currently working through the book Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart . I can already highly recommend it to anybody who is learning Python.
Chapter 9 is about reading and writing files, and there are two assignments at the end of the chapter. Here I’ll discuss my solution of the Mad Libs assignment.

<p>Chapter 9 is about reading and writing files, and there are two assignments at the end of the chapter. Here I’ll discuss my solution of the Mad Libs assignment.</p>
<h3 id="here-is-the-full-assignment-text">here is the full assignment text:</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Mad Libs
Create a Mad Libs program that reads in text files and lets the user add their own text anywhere the word ADJECTIVE, NOUN, ADVERB, or VERB appears in the text file. For example, a text file may look like this:
The ADJECTIVE panda walked to the NOUN and then VERB. A nearby NOUN was
unaffected by these events.

The program would find these occurrences and prompt the user to replace them.
Enter an adjective:
silly
Enter a noun:
chandelier
Enter a verb:
screamed
Enter a noun:
pickup truck

The following text file would then be created:
The silly panda walked to the chandelier and then screamed. A nearby pickup
truck was unaffected by these events.

The results should be printed to the screen and saved to a new text file.
</code></pre><p>Looks pretty simple, right? I went into it with a lot of zeal and started writing a long list of if statements. My first attempts at the solution involved matching the words NOUN and ADJECTIVE directly, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">word</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;ADJECTIVE&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="n">inv</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Enter an adjective: &#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, this is problematic because as you can see, the sentence can contain words with a period attached, such as “VERB.” in the above example.</p>
<h2 id="no-please-no-regex">no, please no regex!</h2>
<p>I’ve understood that here is a general anxiety around regex. I have certainly noticed it in myself and some of my junior engineer friends. As soon as I read the word regex, or realise that an assignment is going to involve regex, I get a constricting feeling in my throat and a rise in my heart rate.</p>
<p>I’ve had to struggle with it quite a bit during my freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certificate, and the memories are still fresh in my mind.</p>
<p>So, like any other ‘rational’ human being, I tried to approach this relatively simple assignment with all sorts of ways trying to account for a period ending the word:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">period_check</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It’s quite funny to see the lengths we go through to avoid regular expressions. However, as you maybe deduce from the code above, it didn’t work, and after a couple of hours of fiddling I gave up, and like any other frustrated programmer, I started to google.</p>
<p>I quickly found solutions to this assignment and they all involved regex, and I realised I could not walk away from my fears anymore.</p>
<h2 id="an-elegant-solution">an elegant solution</h2>
<p>Eventually I ended up with the following result for the part of my assignment that needed to recognise and replace the words with the user input. Of course I heavily borrowed from my Google search results.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># set up and match the regex</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When I say elegant, I mean elegant in total Python beginner terms. I’m sure there are enough Seniors out there who will burst out laughing when they see this. But to me, it was quite an eye-opening experience to see this little piece of code do exactly what I had intended to achieve with 3 different functions and long blocks of if statements.</p>
<p>Also, I was pleasantly surprised with how simple regex can be in Python. In this case there were no scary [Az ^**/!!${}aa{}aA{nF}] statements. We simply defined which words we wanted and called the findall() module to generate a list with all the matches.</p>
<p>Then we iterate over the list of matches and for each match we ask the user for the desired word, and replace it in the source_text.</p>
<h2 id="final-result">final result</h2>
<p>Having sorted out the pattern matching and replacing part, it was only a matter of implementing reading from files and writing to a new file.</p>
