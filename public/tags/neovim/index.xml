      <title>How to Surround a Word with Quotes in Vim</title>

      <description>[[neovim]]
I find myself quoting words very often in vim when I&amp;rsquo;m writing bash code. I used to do this by simply navigating around the word and typing them, but I knew there had to be a better way.
I found this vim command:
ciw&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt;P
&amp;ldquo;c&amp;rdquo; deletes into register and enters insert mode. &amp;ldquo;iw&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;inner word&amp;rdquo; and selects the word.
So we delete the entire word and enter insert mode.</description>

<p>I find myself quoting words very often in vim when I&rsquo;m writing bash code. I used to do this by simply navigating around the word and typing them, but I knew there had to be a better way.</p>
<p>I found this vim command:</p>
<p><code>ciw&quot;&quot;&lt;Esc&gt;P</code></p>
<p>&ldquo;c&rdquo; deletes into register and enters insert mode. &ldquo;iw&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;inner word&rdquo; and selects the word.</p>
<p>So we delete the entire word and enter insert mode. Then we type two quotes, and we press &ldquo;P&rdquo; to paste the register (containing the word) before the cursor.</p>
<p>Voila, the word is surrounded by quotes.</p>
<p>To make it even easier, I added this to my keymaps, and I&rsquo;ll add a few more for parentheses and brackets.</p>
<p><code>vim.keymap.set(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;&lt;leader&gt;wsq&quot;, 'ciw&quot;&quot;&lt;Esc&gt;P', { desc = &quot;Word Surround Quotes&quot; })</code></p>

      <description>I do all my coding and note taking in the terminal using tmux and neovim. I picked up a nice trick from Rob Muhlenstein today.
You can use this command in a split window to keep running a Go file. It will update when you save the file.
entr -c bash -c &amp;quot;go run main.go&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; main.go
Entr runs commands when files change. Here we are feeding it only one file, but you can also feed it a directory like so:</description>

<p>Super handy to see the outcome of your code changes in real time.</p>

      <title>How to follow symbolic links while searching with Telescope in neovim</title>

      <description>I use the Obsidian app, but I mostly write and search my notes with neovim. I added my zet directory from this blog repo into the Obsidian vault as a symbolic link, but I soon discovered that these files were not being searched.
Telescope.nvim uses ripgrep (rg) to do the live grepping in its search, and ripgrep does not follow symbolic links by default. You need to pass the -L flag to it.</description>

      <title>Attaching the Ansible Language Server to yaml files in neovim (LSP)</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/ansible-lsp-fix/</link>

      <description>When you have an Ansible language server installed, you might find that your yaml LSP will attach to your current buffer, but the ansible language server won&amp;rsquo;t attach.
You can fix this by setting the correct file type for the current buffer:
:set ft=yaml.ansible
You could also adjust the Ansible LSP so it attaches to all yaml files. However, this does not work out for me, because I edit different yaml files for different purposes every day.</description>

<p>There is logic for the Ansible language server to figure out if you are working on Ansible yaml files based on the directory structure you&rsquo;re working in.</p>
<p>So setting the filetype when I needed works well for me.</p>

      <title>How This Blog is Created, Written and Hosted</title>

      <description>As I alluded to in my article about Obsidian, I am very fond of editing my text in neovim. Naturally, if you want to edit in neovim, you need to have your text as local files. I keep all of my personal notes in markdown.
Previously I was using WordPress, but the editing and writing experience became torture which I could not endure any longer. I looked for a different solution that would allow me to edit my files locally instead of in the browser.</description>

<p>Previously I was using WordPress, but the editing and writing experience became torture which I could not endure any longer. I looked for a different solution that would allow me to edit my files locally instead of in the browser.</p>
<p>I discovered <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and I fell in love with it immediately.</p>
<p>Hugo is a static site generator based on markdown files. My entire blog is written in markdown files which are stored <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/blog">in a GitHub repo.</a>. I write my blog posts in vim and when I&rsquo;m done I use Hugo to generate the updated website.</p>
<p>The result is what you see in the &ldquo;public&rdquo; directory in the GitHub repo. This public directory is pushed to a different repo which is hooked up to my hosting provider. My hosting provider uses Plesk, and with Plesk I have the option to connect the GitHub repo to the web server with a webhook. When I push to my hosting repo, the contents are gathered by the webserver and served as public web content.</p>
<p>My complete writing and publishing workflow looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new markdown file</li>
<li>Write the note or article</li>
<li>Save the file and run the &ldquo;hugo&rdquo; command to regenerate the website</li>
<li>Run the &ldquo;publish&rdquo; script. This is a custom script I wrote that takes the contents of the &ldquo;public&rdquo; directory to my hosting repo</li>
<li>Push the newly generated website to the hosting repo</li>
<li>And we&rsquo;re live! 🚀 🎉</li>
</ol>
<p>It is such a smooth and convenient process. I can literally have a new note published to the interet within a few minutes, and it is all done from the command line using my favorite tools.</p>

      <title>Getting Started with Neovim: kickstart.nvim</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/kickstart-nvim/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using neovim for over a year now, and I&amp;rsquo;m very happy that I went through the initial difficulty of learning vim. One of the best perks of using neovim is that you can customize your entire editing experience and workflow. However, it can be a daunting experience to start with an empty configuration and set up everything from scratch.
I started with an empty vanilla vim config and slowly added the plugins as I went along.</description>

One of the best perks of using neovim is that you can customize your entire editing experience and workflow. However, it can be a daunting experience to start with an empty configuration and set up everything from scratch.</p>
<p>I started with an empty vanilla vim config and slowly added the plugins as I went along. Videos by content creators such as ThePrimagen were also helpful in getting inspiration on which plugins I might like for my setup. But this might not be suitable for everyone. I was only editing yaml files and writing simple Python scripts at the time, whereas you might be looking for an IDE experience out of the box.</p>
<p>Recently I discovered <a href="https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim">kickstart.nvim</a> by neovim core maintainer TJdeVries.</p>
<p>I decided to give it a try, and I was pleasantly surprised. It is a great starting setup for a beginner. It is simple and does not overwhelm you with thousands of features.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve completely rewritten my config based on kickstart.nvim, and I am delighted with the result. Especially the LSP setup is very well thought out, and it works much better than the setup I came up with on my own.</p>
<p>TJ DeVries also made a <a href="https://youtu.be/stqUbv-5u2s">video</a> introducing kickstart.nvim and going through the initial setup.</p>
<p>I highly recommend kickstart.nvim if you are interested in using neovim and are looking for a sane place to start.</p>

      <title>How and Why I Started Using Vim</title>

      <description>If you are just starting your Linux journey, you might have noticed that a few camps exist in the Linux world. Just like in any other area of life, it seems that groups of human beings enjoy dividing themselves instead of living in harmony. There are camps centered around Linux distributions (I use Arch, btw) but also around text editors.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are just starting your Linux journey, you might have noticed that a few camps exist in the Linux world. Just like in any other area of life, it seems that groups of human beings enjoy dividing themselves instead of living in harmony. There are camps centered around Linux distributions (I use Arch, btw) but also around text editors.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h2>
<p>The reason why I started to use vim is rather practical. During the first part of my traineeship, I had access to subscriptions on AWS and Azure to experiment with virtual machines. This was a perfect place to learn to work with Ansible. Many of the labs involved setting up a few virtual machines, and I destroyed many VMs when I made some big mistakes in the configuration.</p>
<p>I was constantly working on new environments, and quickly it became very tiring to set everything up to connect remotely with Visual Studio Code every time.</p>
<p>So I just started to edit the text files on the virtual machines with the included editor, which happened to be vim.</p>
<h2 id="obsession-in-its-infancy">Obsession in its Infancy</h2>
<p>When you first use vim, it is a rather disorienting experience. But in every tutorial, I was told it would be difficult in the beginning but much faster and more effective in the end. I found this very appealing because I like to do things the hard way and challenge myself.</p>
<p>I discovered that there were people out there who did all of their text editing and coding in vim. I met programmers who refuse to use anything else and people who write entire books in vim. So there had to be something to it.</p>
<p>It also fitted very well with my intention of working on the command line as much as possible and moving away from GUI applications whenever possible. I like to move in this direction because I love the idea of controlling your entire workflow with your keyboard instead of using your mouse, and vim fits perfectly into this picture.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-like-after-nine-months">What I like after Nine Months</h2>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;ve been using vim as my primary text editor for about nine months. In my current job, I work a lot with yaml files stored in private git repositories.</p>
<p>I only work with these files from the command line, and I don&rsquo;t have any other code editor installed. I use ripgrep and fzf (fuzzy file finder) to search through the files, and I use neovim to edit them. When I need to search for files from within vim, I use the awesome Telescope plugin.</p>
<p>In these months, I&rsquo;ve picked up a few tricks, and I am starting to see the power of vim. The best thing I like about it is that I don&rsquo;t have to leave my terminal window to do the tasks I need to do. Instead, I can search through the files I need to work with, open them, make adjustments, and commit them to the repository. Then I enter the command to run the ansible playbook, and it all happens in the same window, and I don&rsquo;t have to lift my fingers from the keyboard.</p>
<h4 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
<p>Now that I am gaining more experience with vim, I&rsquo;m picking up more advanced usages that significantly improve my workflow. For example, &ldquo;da(&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;delete around parentheses&rdquo; to quickly delete the text between two parentheses. Or &ldquo;da&lt;&rdquo; to very quickly delete HTML tags. Another great feature is the visual block mode, where I can add comment tags to many lines simultaneously, for example.</p>
<h4 id="searching-and-navigation">Searching and Navigation</h4>
<p>Navigating large text files has become incredibly quick since I started using vim. Of course, it takes some getting used to, but it is a lovely experience to open a file, press / to search and enter the keyword and immediately arrive at the point I need to be—no scrolling with the mouse and no need to lift my hands from the keyboard.</p>
<p>I also love the ability to jump from sentence to sentence using ) or paragraphs using }.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-files">Multiple Files</h4>
<p>It takes a little while to get used to, but when you get into it, it is effortless to open up two files at a time if you need information from both. Often I need data from 4 or more files, and opening them quickly with keyboard commands has significantly improved my workflow speed.</p>
<h4 id="customization">Customization</h4>
<p>One of the things I enjoy most about vim is the ability to customize it exactly to my needs. I&rsquo;m completely in charge of the plugins which are loaded into vim and which colors it uses, and this appeals a lot to me. However, it can be rather overwhelming in the beginning. To be honest, it is still overwhelming after ten months. It can be tough to get an idea of where to start, which plugins you need, and which settings you need to change.</p>
<p>I just started with the base install of vim and started from there. Every time I required a particular functionality, I searched around to see if a plugin was available. Very often, someone out there had the same problem as you and created a plugin for it. For example, I recently installed a plugin for using emojis in vim 😄</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-started">How to Get Started</h2>
<p>The short answer is to simply start using vim for all of your text editing, whether it be coding or writing for pleasure. It is a cliche to say, but it will be hard in the beginning, but I promise you it will pay off in the end.</p>
<p>The second thing I&rsquo;d recommend is to run vimtutor on a Linux machine. Do this once a day for a couple of weeks, and you&rsquo;ll know how to edit text files on any Linux system for the rest of your life, which is a precious skill.</p>
<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t spend too much time reading about all the available plugins. Your needs will become apparent to you as you start to use vim for all of your tasks, and you can search for plugins to address those needs. This way, you start with a minimal editor, which you&rsquo;ll build according to your needs.</p>
