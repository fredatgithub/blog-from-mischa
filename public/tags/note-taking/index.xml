      <description>Ran into a problem when cloning my second brain repository on a new windows machine which I need to use for work. Also trying to get familiar with VSCode although I&amp;rsquo;m doing my best to get a good WSL setup going on my new windows setup.
One problem I was running into was that I could not for the life of me clone my repository at all on Windows. Eventually I realized that it kept failing on a file that had a question mark in its filename.</description>

<p>One problem I was running into was that I could not for the life of me clone my repository at all on Windows. Eventually I realized that it kept failing on a file that had a question mark in its filename.</p>
<p>I renamed all the files that had invalid characters.</p>
<p>It also failed because apparently I had a file in the repo named &ldquo;&quot;. It didn&rsquo;t like that at all.</p>
<p>After changing the filenames it worked.</p>
<p>It is good to keep my second brain compatible with all operating systems so this is actually a good practice session.</p>
