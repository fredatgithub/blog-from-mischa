      <title>Base Training For Running: Time Instead Of Distance</title>

      <description>I started running on the 13th of February 2023. I ran 1.2 kilometres in 9 minutes. Slowly I built it up to my first 5k which I ran on the 23th of March 2023.
After I discovered a new potential within me now that I lost so much weight, I felt I needed some more structure towards my running training. Reddit, as always, comes to the rescue. On the r/running subreddit I discovered base training.</description>

<p>After I discovered a new potential within me now that I lost so much weight, I felt I needed some more structure towards my running training. Reddit, as always, comes to the rescue. On the r/running subreddit I discovered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/3bckeh/base_training_a_guide_to_your_foundation_to/">base training.</a></p>
<p>I focused completely on the <em>distance ran</em> while slowly working my way up to 5 kilometres. Base training, however, made me focus on the <em>duration</em> of the runs. This was quite an eye opener and changed my perspective.</p>
<p>The idea is that the duration is much more important for beginners because they experience  more stress on the body while running. An experienced runner might finish 10 kilometres in 30 minutes, but a beginner will experience a lot more stress on the body doing 30 minutes of running on an easy pace because there are more foot strikes occurring and because the body is unadapted. The beginner first needs to build up strength in the legs and resistance in the joints and tissues.</p>
<p>So far it has been a good experience. I like the idea of running more often, but not pushing myself every single run. The schedule also allows for variation. Some days are easier than others, so it feels good to have the opportunity to go for only a short 30 minute run on the days where I&rsquo;m not feeling up to it.</p>
<p>Here are the results of my first week:</p>
<h2 id="week-16---1">Week 16 - 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easy Run 1 Mon 30min</li>
<li>Easy Run 2 Wed 43min</li>
<li>Easy Run 3 Thu 36,5min</li>
<li>Easy Run 4 Sun 43min</li>
<li>Long Run   Fri 50min</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Total distance: 20.59km</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>I currently don&rsquo;t have a particular goal in mind. I have a knee injury which started to flare up again when I started running. So far the body has adapted, and the knee stopped hurting. I&rsquo;m going to follow this program for 6 weeks, adding 5 minutes (or more if I feel good) per week to my long run, and see where this takes me.</p>

      <title>Exercise Stimulates Creativity And Motivation</title>

      <description>I noticed multiple times now that during my workouts my mind is generating lots of new ideas for coding projects or blog posts. It is a well known fact that walking stimulates areas in the brain that which will in turn stimulate creativity. But I&amp;rsquo;m noticing that it starts to happen with strength workouts as well.
Although I don&amp;rsquo;t struggle with the motivation to get myself to the gym, I sometimes feel &amp;ldquo;guilty&amp;rdquo; for not spending that time on coding or studying.</description>

<p>Although I don&rsquo;t struggle with the motivation to get myself to the gym, I sometimes feel &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; for not spending that time on coding or studying. I&rsquo;m realizing now that this is a very irrational train of thought.</p>
<p>Exercise actually stimulates my creativity and will help generating new ideas or help me understand concepts better in the unconscious. It is also massively beneficial for health and general well being. When general well-being is enhanced I&rsquo;ll also be able to focus better and absorb information more quickly.</p>
<p>I should re-frame my thinking and actually put exercise as priority number 1. Exercise time is never wasted time. It indirectly contributes to my productivity and coding endeavours as well.</p>

      <title>I ran 5K for the first time in my life!</title>

      <description>Yesterday I reached a significant milestone. I ran my first 5K!
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been on the heavy side. I did a lot of weightlifting from age 18 to around 27 and I was always rather bulky, but very strong. This meant I was very good at working in the woods or helping people move house, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to do any running or endurance because my knees would start protesting very quickly.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been on the heavy side. I did a lot of weightlifting from age 18 to around 27 and I was always rather bulky, but very strong. This meant I was very good at working in the woods or helping people move house, but I&rsquo;ve never been able to do any running or endurance because my knees would start protesting very quickly. However, I always admired endurance athletes and I had the desire to be able to run more than a few minutes without feeling the urge to die on the spot.</p>
<p>Over the past 1,5 years I lost 20kg (~44 pounds) so I decided to give it yet another try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been this lightweight so I decided to give running another try. I started small with only 10 minutes but over the course of two months I built it up gradually.</p>
<p>Last week I ran 4km and it felt pretty good, so I just decided to push a little bit more and try for my goal of 5k, and it went well! It feels like quite an accomplishment to me.</p>
<p>Now that I lost all this weight running actually feels good, and it is liberating to discover a whole new area of exercise that I haven&rsquo;t explored yet: endurance. Looking back to my progress over a couple of months, I&rsquo;m curious how far I&rsquo;ll come and what my limits are.</p>
