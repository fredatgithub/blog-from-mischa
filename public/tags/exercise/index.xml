      <description>It was a nice week. I had an extra day off on Asenscion day and I decided to go for a camping trip for the first time after I moved back to the Netherlands.
It was a great experience, and I wrote a couple of Tumblr posts with photos:

      <title>üçé My Weight Loss Journey And Current Goal üìâ</title>

      <description>I started my weight loss journey in December 2021 on 97,7kg and steadily dropped weight over the following year.
I achieved this by intermittent fasting and cutting out junk food as the first main intervention. I was already used to eating only 8 hours a day, but I experimented with shortening this window and doing 36 hour or 48 hour fasts.
Eventually I plateaued, and there was no way around it: I needed to start tracking calories strictly.</description>

<p>I achieved this by intermittent fasting and cutting out junk food as the first main intervention. I was already used to eating only 8 hours a day, but I experimented with shortening this window and doing 36 hour or 48 hour fasts.</p>
<p>Eventually I plateaued, and there was no way around it: I needed to start tracking calories strictly. I made a habit of weighing all of my food and entering it to an app (YAZIO). Periods of weight loss strictly correlate with my adherence to this practice.</p>
<p>The weight loss plateaued in 2022/2023.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/weightloss2.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Even though I kept bouncing back up when I reached 76kg, I&rsquo;m still really satisfied that I managed to keep the weight off so far.According to Layne Norton in his book &ldquo;Fat Loss Forever&rdquo;, only 5% of people who undertake weight loss journeys actually manage to keep the weight off.</p>
<p>The main intervention for me here is to weigh myself daily. I&rsquo;ve gone from periods where I was strictly counting calories to periods where I was eyeballing things and trying to eat intuitively, leading to weight gain. But as soon as I started creeping to the 80kg mark, I knew I had to reign myself in again.</p>
<h1 id="current-goal">Current Goal</h1>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;m managing to keep the weight off, I&rsquo;m not satisfied with my current weight.  My goal is to reach 10% body fat. I realized that simply &ldquo;losing weight&rdquo; was not going to cut it anymore because I kept bouncing back up. I needed to become more intentional about my weight loss.</p>
<p>I did some insightful research on goal setting and realized that I needed to set a clear goal within a timeframe and track the progress towards that goal. <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-setting-and-achieving-goals/">Huberman&rsquo;s Podcast episode on goal setting</a> was very¬†enlightening here.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/weightloss3.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>Again my weight creeped up from 76kg to 80kg and I decided I had enough.</p>
<p>Since my breakpoint always seems to be 76kg, I set my goal to 75kg within a time frame of 2 months.</p>
<p>My starting weight was 78.6kg and this morning I weighed in at 77.3kg. So far it&rsquo;s working, it&rsquo;s about 0,5kg a week which is a healthy amount to lose in a week&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>I made this little sheet which hangs on my kitchen cupboard, and every day I mark whether I adhered to my calorie target of 1700kcal +/- 100kcal. The squares indicate a day where I do a 500kcal fasting day.</p>
<h2 id="current-weight-loss-interventions">Current Weight Loss Interventions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Calorie target: 1700kcal</li>
<li>Two meals a day in a 4 hour eating window</li>
<li>20 hours of fasting a day</li>
<li>Strictly tracking all calories, even when overeating</li>
<li>5:2 pattern: two days of fasting a week where I eat a small meal of 500 calories</li>
<li>Running 5+ times a week</li>
<li>Two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkY6MM_dLo4&amp;t=18s&amp;pp=ygUJdGFvIHJpbmdz">ring workouts</a> a week</li>
</ul>
<p>When I list them all out, it seems extreme that I need this many interventions to lose those last few kilograms of fat. But apparently it is all necessary. If/when I start losing more than 0.5kg a week I&rsquo;ll know I can reduce the intensity by increasing my calorie target.</p>
<h2 id="accountability">Accountability</h2>
<p>When I made this sheet I shared it with my brother and a few friends for external accountability. So far I&rsquo;ve just been doing my journey alone, but as I got stuck at around 77kg, I upped the ante and started to involve others. It really helps to stick with the program. It would be very embarassing to make this kind of commitment and not sticking with it.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m two weeks in, and the results are starting to show, I decided to make it completely public and post it on my blog. So we&rsquo;ll see in two months if I&rsquo;m making a fool out of myself or not ü•≤</p>

      <title>Base Training For Running: Time Instead Of Distance</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/base-training-running/</link>

      <description>I started running on the 13th of February 2023. I ran 1.2 kilometres in 9 minutes. Slowly I built it up to my first 5k which I ran on the 23th of March 2023.
After I discovered a new potential within me now that I lost so much weight, I felt I needed some more structure towards my running training. Reddit, as always, comes to the rescue. On the r/running subreddit I discovered base training.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started running on the 13th of February 2023. I ran 1.2 kilometres in 9 minutes. Slowly I built it up to my first 5k which I ran on the 23th of March 2023.</p>
<p>After I discovered a new potential within me now that I lost so much weight, I felt I needed some more structure towards my running training. Reddit, as always, comes to the rescue. On the r/running subreddit I discovered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/3bckeh/base_training_a_guide_to_your_foundation_to/">base training.</a></p>
<p>I focused completely on the <em>distance ran</em> while slowly working my way up to 5 kilometres. Base training, however, made me focus on the <em>duration</em> of the runs. This was quite an eye opener and changed my perspective.</p>
<p>The idea is that the duration is much more important for beginners because they experience  more stress on the body while running. An experienced runner might finish 10 kilometres in 30 minutes, but a beginner will experience a lot more stress on the body doing 30 minutes of running on an easy pace because there are more foot strikes occurring and because the body is unadapted. The beginner first needs to build up strength in the legs and resistance in the joints and tissues.</p>
<p>So far it has been a good experience. I like the idea of running more often, but not pushing myself every single run. The schedule also allows for variation. Some days are easier than others, so it feels good to have the opportunity to go for only a short 30 minute run on the days where I&rsquo;m not feeling up to it.</p>
<p>Here are the results of my first week:</p>
<h2 id="week-16---1">Week 16 - 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easy Run 1 Mon 30min</li>
<li>Easy Run 2 Wed 43min</li>
<li>Easy Run 3 Thu 36,5min</li>
<li>Easy Run 4 Sun 43min</li>
<li>Long Run   Fri 50min</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Total distance: 20.59km</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>I currently don&rsquo;t have a particular goal in mind. I have a knee injury which started to flare up again when I started running. So far the body has adapted, and the knee stopped hurting. I&rsquo;m going to follow this program for 6 weeks, adding 5 minutes (or more if I feel good) per week to my long run, and see where this takes me.</p>

      <title>Exercise Stimulates Creativity And Motivation</title>

      <description>I noticed multiple times now that during my workouts my mind is generating lots of new ideas for coding projects or blog posts. It is a well known fact that walking stimulates areas in the brain that which will in turn stimulate creativity. But I&amp;rsquo;m noticing that it starts to happen with strength workouts as well.
Although I don&amp;rsquo;t struggle with the motivation to get myself to the gym, I sometimes feel &amp;ldquo;guilty&amp;rdquo; for not spending that time on coding or studying.</description>

<p>Although I don&rsquo;t struggle with the motivation to get myself to the gym, I sometimes feel &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; for not spending that time on coding or studying. I&rsquo;m realizing now that this is a very irrational train of thought.</p>
<p>Exercise actually stimulates my creativity and will help generating new ideas or help me understand concepts better in the unconscious. It is also massively beneficial for health and general well being. When general well-being is enhanced I&rsquo;ll also be able to focus better and absorb information more quickly.</p>
<p>I should re-frame my thinking and actually put exercise as priority number 1. Exercise time is never wasted time. It indirectly contributes to my productivity and coding endeavours as well.</p>

      <title>I ran 5K for the first time in my life!</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/ran-5km/</link>

      <description>Yesterday I reached a significant milestone. I ran my first 5K!
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been on the heavy side. I did a lot of weightlifting from age 18 to around 27 and I was always rather bulky, but very strong. This meant I was very good at working in the woods or helping people move house, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to do any running or endurance because my knees would start protesting very quickly.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I reached a significant milestone. I ran my first 5K!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been on the heavy side. I did a lot of weightlifting from age 18 to around 27 and I was always rather bulky, but very strong. This meant I was very good at working in the woods or helping people move house, but I&rsquo;ve never been able to do any running or endurance because my knees would start protesting very quickly. However, I always admired endurance athletes and I had the desire to be able to run more than a few minutes without feeling the urge to die on the spot.</p>
<p>Over the past 1,5 years I lost 20kg (~44 pounds) so I decided to give it yet another try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been this lightweight so I decided to give running another try. I started small with only 10 minutes but over the course of two months I built it up gradually.</p>
<p>Last week I ran 4km and it felt pretty good, so I just decided to push a little bit more and try for my goal of 5k, and it went well! It feels like quite an accomplishment to me.</p>
<p>Now that I lost all this weight running actually feels good, and it is liberating to discover a whole new area of exercise that I haven&rsquo;t explored yet: endurance. Looking back to my progress over a couple of months, I&rsquo;m curious how far I&rsquo;ll come and what my limits are.</p>
