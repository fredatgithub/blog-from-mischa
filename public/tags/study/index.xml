      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m typing this 30 minutes after I passed my AZ-400 exam. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in a lovely cafe on Leidseplein in Amsterdam and feel relieved. Another significant certification bites the dust. This one took about 70 hours of study.
I started preparing immediately after passing my AZ-104 exam, which was a good move. The AZ-400 requires you to know many details about Azure services and how to access them. For example, Shared Access Signatures are only used for accessing storage accounts, but they came up quite often as alternative answers to the questions.</description>

For example, Shared Access Signatures are only used for accessing storage accounts, but they came up quite often as alternative answers to the questions.</p>
<p>The exam itself was difficult, but the AZ-104 was harder. The AZ-104 exam was more challenging because the questions were complicated and required you to simultaneously balance many different factors in the mind. The AZ-400 was difficult because the answer alternatives that are provided are incredibly similar to each other, and they make you very insecure about what the right choice might be. As a result, I changed my answers many times.</p>
<p>I will do another study guide for this certification soon and publish my notes and Anki deck too. Now it&rsquo;s time to celebrate and relax a little.</p>

      <title>The Pomodoro technique has won me over</title>

      <description>I did a lot of studying last year, and I achieved a few tough certifications. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been good at studying and never struggled with getting decent grades in university. As a result, I never felt the need to use particular techniques to pass my tests. However, now that I need to do my studies combined with a full-time job, I did some optimization and looked into study techniques.
One technique I&amp;rsquo;ve become very fond of is the Pomodoro Technique.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I did a lot of studying last year, and I achieved a few tough certifications. I&rsquo;ve always been good at studying and never struggled with getting decent grades in university. As a result, I never felt the need to use particular techniques to pass my tests. However, now that I need to do my studies combined with a full-time job, I did some optimization and looked into study techniques.</p>
<p>One technique I&rsquo;ve become very fond of is the Pomodoro Technique. I don&rsquo;t have any problems focusing for long periods, but I still decided to try it. I use the standard 25-minute study with a 5-minute break routine, and after four cycles, I take a 30-minute break.</p>
<p>The Pomodoro technique has been a way to force myself to take breaks, which I wasn&rsquo;t used to. I used to chip away at a specific task for hours. However, I discovered that when I take a break, walk around for five minutes, and apply myself to the task again, my mind is in a fresh state and much more receptive to the information. Perhaps the time I spend studying after a break is actually more productive because the mind had a little rest.</p>
<p>The technique also pushed my limits a bit more. I study more hours a day, considering that I also work full time. There is this moment where I want to quit studying, but I ask myself, &ldquo;do I have another Pomodoro in me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve gotten used to breaking things up into 25-minute chunks of time, I started using the Pomodoro technique for other areas in life as well, such as blog writing or coding projects.</p>
<p>You can use any tool you like to start using the Pomodoro technique and pick any break schedule that suits you. I&rsquo;ll link some resources below. All you need is some sort of timer. You can use a timer on your computer or a physical timer. I use the Forest app on my iPhone because it integrates with the iOs &ldquo;do not disturb&rdquo; and &ldquo;focus&rdquo; modes, so  I don&rsquo;t get any distracting notifications when I&rsquo;m on a Pomodoro.</p>

      <title>Obsidian: A Note Taking App For DevOps Engineers</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/obsidian-introduction/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 19:05:13 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>As a DevOps or Cloud engineer, you work with many different technologies daily. Therefore, a good engineer needs a solid foundation in Linux, a lot of knowledge about your cloud solution, networking, CI/CD, at least one programming language, and many other topics.
Not only are there many of these categories, but within these categories, there are several alternatives. For example, in the category of infrastructure management, there is Ansible, Puppet, or Chef, each with its particular approach and configuration methods.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a DevOps or Cloud engineer, you work with many different technologies daily. Therefore, a good engineer needs a solid foundation in Linux, a lot of knowledge about your cloud solution, networking, CI/CD, at least one programming language, and many other topics.</p>
<p>Not only are there many of these categories, but within these categories, there are several alternatives. For example, in the category of infrastructure management, there is Ansible, Puppet, or Chef, each with its particular approach and configuration methods.</p>
<p>It can be challenging to keep everything memorized at all times. However, when I started my journey to become a DevOps engineer, I kept meticulous notes of everything I learned, and this practice has been highly beneficial so far. This blog is a result of the notes I keep every day.</p>
<p>Note-taking is an essential part of the DevOps engineer&rsquo;s toolkit. It allows you to stay organized, track changes, document processes, and keep track of important information. Using a powerful note-taking app like Obsidian can streamline your note-taking process and work more efficiently.</p>
<h1 id="obsidian-for-devops-engineers">Obsidian for DevOps engineers</h1>
<p>Having a reliable and efficient system in place for managing your notes and documentation is crucial. That&rsquo;s where <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> comes in. Obsidian is a powerful note-taking app that can help you organize and manage your notes more efficiently.</p>
<p>One of the main features of Obsidian is its use of &ldquo;vaults.&rdquo; A vault is a folder containing your notes as markdown text files. Your notes are stored on your machine rather than in the cloud. This gives you complete control over your data. You always have access to your local text files and can interact with them or back them up as you see fit.</p>
<p>Because your notes are stored as markdown files, you can use different tools to write or edit your notes. I mostly use neovim for editing, but I use the Obsidian application for making new links and visualization. Moreover, storing your notes as files allows you to run python scripts on your notes and customize your workflow as needed. This can be especially useful for automating tasks, streamlining your work, or making bulk updates.</p>
<h1 id="links-and-graph-view">Links and graph view</h1>
<p>In addition to its local storage capabilities, Obsidian also offers several other valuable features for DevOps engineers. For example, you can use the &ldquo;graph view&rdquo; to visualize your notes and see how they&rsquo;re related to one another. This can be particularly useful for understanding complex systems and tracking changes over time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/graph-view.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>These relations between notes are created by &ldquo;[[markdown links]]&rdquo;. When a note receives many links, its dot size will increase on the graph view, and in this manner, it is easy to see which notes or topics are significant in your vault and play an important role in your life.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/local-graph.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p>This is the local graph view, showing all the linked notes to my Linux note.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Many note-taking apps, such as Evernote, Notion, or Roam research, are available. I tried a few of these, but Obsidian was the best solution for me. Mainly because your notes are stored as markdown files on your machine and because they offer a syncing service with end-to-end encryption. Their graph view provides an interesting way to navigate your notes and discover unexpected connections.</p>
<p>Give it a try. It&rsquo;s free.</p>

      <title>Study Guide: AZ-104 Azure Administrator Associate</title>

      <description>TLDR It took me 80 hours of studying to gain this certification. Here are my notes and Anki deck: GitHub repo
Introduction When I did my English degree at University, exams were usually handwritten essays that needed to be done within a 3-hour timeframe. Sometimes we had multiple-choice tests, and I would always consider them a guaranteed pass because multiple-choice was much easier in my experience.
That opinion has changed since I&amp;rsquo;ve obtained a few IT certifications.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="tldr">TLDR</h1>
<p>It took me 80 hours of studying to gain this certification. Here are my notes and Anki deck:
<a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/az-104-azure-administrator">GitHub repo</a></p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>When I did my English degree at University, exams were usually handwritten essays that needed to be done within a 3-hour timeframe. Sometimes we had multiple-choice tests, and I would always consider them a guaranteed pass because multiple-choice was much easier in my experience.</p>
<p>That opinion has changed since I&rsquo;ve obtained a few IT certifications. These tests are hard! I&rsquo;m typing this while sitting on the bus on my way home from my AZ-104 exam. I passed with an 860 score of 1000, where 700 or higher is a pass. But it was an astonishingly tough exam. Usually, I finish quickly and spend at least half an hour reviewing my answers. I had only 5 minutes to review my questions this time because I had used up all of the available time. The questions required intense concentration and were time-consuming because I needed to compare many options which were very similar to each other. There were no easy questions.</p>
<h1 id="preparation">Preparation</h1>
<p>I studied 80 hours for this exam in a month. I work full-time as a DevOps Engineer, so I study in the evenings and on weekends. I have my Azure Fundamentals and CKA, but I only work with Azure occasionally in my current role.</p>
<p>Here is what I did to prepare for my exam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through all of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-104">Microsoft Learn modules for the AZ-104</a></li>
<li>Watch the entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nGlGPWs9xaLKT1KfwqREHbs">AZ-104 study list by John Savill</a></li>
<li>Practice exams on <a href="https://tutorialsdojo.com/">TutorialsDojo</a> until I could pass them with 90%+ scores</li>
<li>Microsoft ESI practice exams</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/exam-readiness-zone/preparing-for-az-104-manage-azure-identities-and-governance-1-of-5">Microsoft AZ-104 Exam prep videos</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microsoft-learn">Microsoft Learn</h2>
<p>You really need to master all of the subject matter. Only completing the Microsoft Learn modules is not enough preparation. They are more like summaries. At the end of each module, they provide links to the documentation for the subject for further study. Unfortunately, Microsoft does not go easy on you. It expects you to know obscure details of nearly every service this exam covers. Therefore, I advise going beyond the Microsoft Learn modules and studying the linked articles after each module.</p>
<h2 id="youtube-az-104-study-playlist-by-john-savill">YouTube AZ-104 Study Playlist by John Savill</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s better to watch this playlist first and then do the Microsoft modules or the other way around. I did the Microsoft modules first, but for my next exam (AZ-400 DevOps Expert), I&rsquo;ll start with the videos and then do the Microsoft Learn modules.</p>
<h2 id="tutorialsdojo">Tutorialsdojo</h2>
<p>These practice exams are excellent. I used them in preparation for my fundamentals exam.</p>
<p>The best thing about them is that they provide extensive documentation and explanation of the questions. So after you finish the exam, you can study a lot with these examples.</p>
<h2 id="esi-practice-exams">ESI Practice Exams</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re lucky if your organization participates in Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="esi.microsoft.com/">Enterprise Skills Initiative</a>. The practice exams provided in the ESI environment give you a good indication of what you can expect at the exam. I first did the Tutorialsdojo exams and then moved on to the ESI exams, and I was humiliated. The ESI questions are very complex and hard to solve, and I learned a lot from these exams.</p>
<p>There are 210 questions total, and I worked through all of them, and whenever I failed a question, I did a deeper dive into the question&rsquo;s theme.</p>
<h1 id="studying">studying</h1>
<p>I take notes in Obsidian, and I use Anki for spaced repetition. I highly recommend keeping a deck of Anki cards and continuously testing yourself. You will need to memorize a lot of details. For example, you are expected to remember that storage accounts of the FileStorage type do not support Geo Redundant Storage. You can find my Anki deck in the <a href="https://github.com/mischavandenburg/az-104-azure-administrator">GitHub repo.</a></p>

      <description>I recently obtained my CKA certification. I started this certification journey with zero knowledge of Kubernetes. However, I was already working as a DevOps Engineer, and I know a fair bit of Linux. I daily drive Arch Linux and have LPIC-1 certification. It was handy to know where files are located on Linux systems and how to interact with systemd services. I also knew yaml quite well because I work with Ansible daily.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently obtained my CKA certification. I started this certification journey with zero knowledge of Kubernetes. However, I was already working as a DevOps Engineer, and I know a fair bit of Linux. I daily drive Arch Linux and have LPIC-1 certification. It was handy to know where files are located on Linux systems and how to interact with systemd services. I also knew yaml quite well because I work with Ansible daily. I passed on my first try, and I did one session of killer.sh.</p>
<h3 id="my-preparation">My preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/">KodeKloud CKA Course</a></li>
<li><a href="https://killer.sh/">Killer.sh Mock Exam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://killercoda.com/killer-shell-cka">Killercoda</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I kept track of the time I spent on this certification. In total, I spent 80 hours on study and practice.</p>
<h3 id="in-hindsight">In Hindsight</h3>
<p>I spent too much time repeating things during the KodeKloud course. This is the one thing I would do differently if I could start over. I went over some modules multiple times and kept meticulous notes. However, I have hardly used any of those notes. But they will be nice to have for the future.</p>
<p>I learned most from the killer.sh exams. So I would advise you to go through the KodeKloud course and do all the exercises, but don&rsquo;t spend too much time repeating stuff. If you don&rsquo;t understand the topic at all, it is, of course, necessary to repeat it. But you don&rsquo;t need to know all the details.</p>
<h3 id="killersh">Killer.sh</h3>
<p>After I finished the KodeKloud course, I purchased the exam voucher and started the killer.sh on Saturday morning. I wanted to simulate the exam experience as much as possible, so I set the timer and did not allow myself to stand up for two hours. My first round was humiliating. I only managed to get 24 out of 125 points. A little shocked by the experience, I spent the whole Saturday going through all the solutions of the exercises that killer.sh provides. The explanations they give are extensive, and I found them helpful. Saturday evening, I went out for dinner with friends, and on Sunday morning, I passed killer.sh. I spent the whole Sunday studying the solutions more and more, and on my last try on Sunday evening, I scored 115 out of 125.</p>
<h2 id="tips">Tips:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I know tmux quite well and used it extensively during the killer.sh, but it was not necessary during the exam. No need to learn it if you don&rsquo;t know it already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowing vim well will save you a lot of time at the exam. For example, dG to delete all lines until the end of the file from your current location. Run &ldquo;vimtutor&rdquo; on a Linux system to learn the basics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot use bookmarks. Learn how to search the docs efficiently. One handy one I figured out was to control + F and enter &ldquo;kind: Pod&rdquo; or &ldquo;kind: PersistentVolume&rdquo; to immediately go to the example YAML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my exam environment did not need much extra configuration. All I added to my .bashrc was alias v=vim and export do=&quot;&ndash;dry-run=client -o yaml&quot; so you can use &ldquo;k run Nginx $do &gt; Nginx.YAML&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exam environment is not as bad as people make it out to be on the internet. There is a little delay while scrolling through the docs in the browser, but working in the terminal didn&rsquo;t give me any problems. Get used to the environment on killer.sh, and there should not be any surprises in the real exam environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skip questions you cannot solve immediately. But don&rsquo;t spend time reviewing all the questions, sorting by the highest % and doing those first. You will lose a lot of time evaluating all of these questions. It is much better to solve the questions during your first pass through and skip the ones you cannot immediately solve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the 120-minute timer ran out, I was presented with a screen that said &ldquo;quit&rdquo; or &ldquo;request more time.&rdquo; I was pretty sure I could not get more time for this exam, so I just pressed &ldquo;quit.&rdquo; After I pressed quit, the application closed immediately, and there was no confirmation whatsoever that they received my exam results or anything. This was extremely disorienting, and I was left doubting if I had done it correctly. Eventually, I could see in the Linux Foundation portal that my exam was in Grading status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed is of the essence. An hour before my exam, I used killercoda to get into the mood and get things up to speed. Learn to solve things quickly and don&rsquo;t spend time having to arrange terminal windows on your screen or stumbling around in vim. You cannot afford to lose time on these things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, this video is an excellent summary of all the necessary tips and information: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VK9NJ3pObU"></a></p>

      <title>LPIC-1 Study Guide</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/lpic-1-study-guide/</link>

      <description>I recently obtained my LPIC-1 certification, and in this blog post, I’ll share the strategy and techniques I used to pass this exam and share my thoughts on the certification. Because I am a Linux novice, the exam was a pretty tough grind for me. This article offers a beginner’s perspective on the LPIC-1 certification. Is the LPIC-1 hard to pass? Keep reading to find out.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently obtained my LPIC-1 certification, and in this blog post, I’ll share the strategy and techniques I used to pass this exam and share my thoughts on the certification. Because I am a Linux novice, the exam was a pretty tough grind for me. This article offers a beginner’s perspective on the LPIC-1 certification. Is the LPIC-1 hard to pass? Keep reading to find out.</p>
<p>Before this certification, I had only a little bit of experience. I deployed LAMP stacks using Ansible and configured VMs to be able to communicate with each other using only the command line. I also did a “Linux Fundamentals” video training. I could navigate the filesystem, edit text files and work in the terminal, but that was about it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/hard.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<h3 id="is-it-hard">Is it hard?</h3>
<p>For a beginner: yes, it was hard! But if you are a Linux administrator with a few years of experience, these exams probably are not very difficult to pass. However, even if you are experienced, be prepared to do a lot of memorization. Even though the requirements on the website seem very basic and straightforward, when you dig into the study resources, you will soon discover that you need to learn a large host of commands and many of their accompanying parameters. For example, you will need to know what grep -H does precisely, the difference between passwd -l, chage -l, and chage -L, the location of the directory that contains all the timezones, and the directory that contains the printer configurations for CUPS.</p>
<h3 id="the-certification">The certification</h3>
<p>The LPIC-1 certificate requires candidates to pass the LPI 101-500 and 102-500 exams. These exams test the candidates on various subjects, such as file management, boot loaders, networking fundamentals, user and group management, file systems and partitioning, and much more.</p>
<p>Each exam has a 600-page syllabus, so to get your LPIC-1 certification, you need to work through 1200 pages and memorize a few hundred commands and parameters. However, if you work as a Linux sysadmin, you’ll probably know many of these commands and concepts.</p>
<h3 id="study-materials">Study Materials</h3>
<p>I attended a 4-day course that covered both exams. However, because of the large amount of information that needs to be covered, the teacher could only address the subjects on a superficial level. Therefore, I would advise you to be suspicious of any courses that promise to prep you for the exams in 4 days if you are a beginner. I estimate that you need at least double that amount to get some proper explanation of the material.</p>
<h4 id="lpi-syllabus">LPI Syllabus</h4>
<p>After finishing the course, it became clear that I needed a lot of studying to pass the exams. Fortunately, LPI has created a syllabus for each exam. These are available for free on the <a href="https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-1-overview">LPI.org website.</a></p>
<h4 id="lpi-practice-exams">LPI Practice Exams</h4>
<p>It is crucial to test your knowledge. This is the resource I used:</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3KHAkCZ">LPIC-1 Linux Professional Institute Certification Practice Tests: Exam 101-500 and Exam 102-500 </a></p>
<p>If you are a member of O’Reilly’s, you can read the book there. It contains around 90 practice questions for every chapter in the LPI syllabus. The questions test your knowledge in detail and are a great way to determine whether you have fully grasped the material.</p>
<p>However, the book was written in 2019 and contains questions about certain subjects that have since been removed from the exams. So if you suddenly encounter questions that do not seem familiar at all, make sure to double-check that it is actually an exam objective.</p>
<p>Lastly, I used <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/1029gO3@XonS1Jh2QkFmIV_mN-r8Rbx04vCYiyykPhTpewu5iLZQVNIYMVe4z53YFSxp2tly/">these practice exams on Udemy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="memorization">Memorization</h3>
<p>As I have stated before, the exams require you to do a lot of memorization. Fortunately, we have some tools and techniques available to help us with this task.</p>
<p>The primary tool is Anki. If you are not familiar with it, Anki is a very simple and free program that allows you to create flashcards that you can use to study and test your knowledge. The best thing about Anki is that it implements spaced repetition. You can download and learn more about Anki here: <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">https://apps.ankiweb.net</a></p>
<p>Secondly, I am fond of memory techniques. You can remember things much more quickly by visualizing them in your mind or utilizing techniques such as Memory Palaces or the Method of Loci. If you are interested in learning more about memory techniques, I highly recommend Dr. Anthony Metivier’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AnthonyMetivierMMM/featured">YouTube channel.</a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/palace.jpg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>
<p>Here is the strategy that I used to pass the exams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read through a chapter and take notes.</li>
<li>Make Anki flashcards for all the commands and flags that you do not know yet</li>
<li>Do the exercises at the end of the chapter</li>
<li>Do the practice exam for your chapter from the exam book, which should give you a good indication of how well you have grasped the material.</li>
<li>Make flashcards of all the questions that you answered wrong (trust me, there will be quite a few)</li>
<li>Use Anki to test yourself and memorize all of the commands and exam questions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tips">Tips:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do your Anki reviews every day. On some days I was adding more than 100 new cards, which will lead to a lot of reviews in the coming days</li>
<li>Although the syllabus for exam 101 explained things very well, the 102 syllabus sometimes is very meager in its explanations and you might need to supplement with reading man pages, YouTube videos, and other tutorials. For example, I needed to find quite a bit of supplementary material for chapter 109 Networking Fundamentals.</li>
<li>Ask for help if you don’t understand a certain topic</li>
<li>Don’t think you can get away with skipping a topic. You will be tested on absolutely everything that’s in the syllabus, trust me.</li>
<li>Try doing it together with someone else. I was doing it together with my friend and colleague, and it was extremely useful to be able to share things I struggled with and to discuss things with him to understand them better. Thank you for the good times, Gino!</li>

<h3 id="my-thoughts-on-the-certification">My thoughts on the certification</h3>
<p>The subject matter is extensive, and I know my way around Linux much better now. Therefore, if I encounter a problem, I am better positioned to assess where the cause might be and then solve the problem from there. I also feel I have a much better grasp of basic networking concepts, which will prove to be very useful in many situations in my work as a DevOps Engineer.</p>
<p>However, there are also a few drawbacks to this certification. I think there is too much emphasis on memorizing commands and their flags. I think it is not necessary to memorize all of the possible parameters of the chage command because, in the real world, I would take a quick look at the man page to find the parameter that I need. The exams force you to memorize many parameters in a short time, and to be honest, you will probably forget about them very quickly anyway.</p>
<p>But overall, I am pleased and grateful to my employer that I was able to obtain this certification, and it has made me hungry for more, and I am very eager to continue my learning in this domain.</p>
