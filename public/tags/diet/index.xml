      <description>Professor Longo recommends eating the same ingredients that your ancestors ate in his book The Longevity Diet.
Today I asked my 91 year old grandmother about her diet and her eating habits when she was younger. She was around 10 years old during the Second World War when food was very scarce and people were struggling to survive. I knew already that meat was a luxury product during her early life and that they consumed meat maybe once or twice a week in small quantities.</description>

<p>Today I asked my 91 year old grandmother about her diet and her eating habits when she was younger. She was around 10 years old during the Second World War when food was very scarce and people were struggling to survive. I knew already that meat was a luxury product during her early life and that they consumed meat maybe once or twice a week in small quantities.</p>
<p>From our conversation I learned the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>they ate three meals a day: breakfast, a larger warm midday meal and a light evening meal</li>
<li>the staples were oatmeal, rice (which surprised me), potatoes, carrots, bread, milk, cheese and eggs</li>
<li>breakfast was usually oatmeal porridge</li>
<li>they ate dinner at noon and had a light meal in the evening, usually a couple of slices of bread</li>
<li>dinner was often rice porridge boiled in milk or potatoes with carrots, onions and a little meat (hutspot)</li>
<li>she had never eaten french fries until she was 60 years old</li>
<li>they didn&rsquo;t have any snacks</li>
<li>sometimes she was sent to bed with only a carrot</li>
</ul>
<p>I have always loved eating oatmeal, rice, bread and potatoes, and I never grow tired of these ingredients. Now I know why! It is exactly what my ancestors ate. I will keep eating these as main staples of my diet.</p>
<p>Especially the rice was surprising to me, I didn&rsquo;t know that rice was generally available during that time already but apparently it was.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading The Longevity Diet by professor Valter Longo after encountering him in several podcasts.
I&amp;rsquo;m always experimenting with diet protols and this one seems interesting because its plant based but has an eating pattern that is very different from what I&amp;rsquo;m used to. I&amp;rsquo;ve been intermittent fasting for over 8 years and my eating windows have varied from 1 to 10 hours, usually skipping breakfast. However, based on his research, professor Longo recommends not skipping breakfast and skipping lunch instead.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading The Longevity Diet by professor Valter Longo after encountering him in several podcasts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always experimenting with diet protols and this one seems interesting because its plant based but has an eating pattern that is very different from what I&rsquo;m used to. I&rsquo;ve been intermittent fasting for over 8 years and my eating windows have varied from 1 to 10 hours, usually skipping breakfast. However, based on his research, professor Longo recommends not skipping breakfast and skipping lunch instead.</p>
<p>Based on his research on centenarians he recommends eating a pescetarian diet with two small servings of high quality fish a week. I don&rsquo;t like seafood however, the thought of eating something that has been swimming around in our polluted seas absorbing heavy metals and microplastics repulses me. I will have to see if I can find high quality fish. Soon I will be doing a blood test with Inside Tracker to see how my levels of nutrients are. If everything looks good I will probably wait with including fish into my diet. However, if it extends my lifespan and improves my health and well being I am willing to start eating a pescetarian diet.</p>
<p>Additionally, professor Longo recommends doing a 5 day fast at leat twice a year where you consume about 800 calories a day, which he calls a Fasting Mimicking Diet.</p>
<p>My main takeaways which I&rsquo;m implementing now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start eating two meals a day, breakfast and dinner plus a 100 calorie snack</li>
<li>12 hour eating window</li>
<li>Do a 5 day fast 4 times a year</li>
<li>Consider eating fish twice a week, start looking for high quality sources</li>
<li>Research what my ancestors ate and select main ingredients accordingly</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-longevity-diet-for-adults">The Longevity Diet for Adults</h1>
<ol>
<li>Eat mostly vegan, plus a little fish, limiting meals with fish to a maximum of two or three per week. Choose fish, crustaceans, and mollusks with a high omega-3, omega-6, and vitamin B12 content (salmon, anchovies, sardines, cod, sea bream, trout, clams, shrimp.  Pay attention to the quality of the fish, choosing those with low levels of mercury.</li>
<li>If you are below the age of 65, keep protein intake low (0.31 to 0.36 grams per pound of body weight). That comes to 40 to 47 grams of proteins per day for a person weighing 130 pounds, and 60 to 70 grams of protein per day for someone weighing 200 to 220 pounds. (100kg) Over age 65, you should slightly increase protein intake but also increase consumption of fish, eggs, white meat, and products derived from goats and sheep to preserve muscle mass. Consume beans, chickpeas, green peas, and other legumes as your main source of protein.</li>
<li>Minimize saturated fats from animal and vegetable sources (meat, cheese) and sugar, and maximize good fats and complex carbs. Eat whole grains and high quantities of vegetables (tomatoes, broccoli, carrots, legumes, etc.) with generous amounts of olive oil (3 tablespoons per day) and nuts (1 ounce per day). (30g)</li>
<li>Follow a diet with high vitamin and mineral content, supplemented with a multivitamin buffer every three days.</li>
<li>Select ingredients among those discussed in this book that your ancestors would have eaten.</li>
<li>Based on your weight, age, and abdominal circumference, decide whether to have two or three meals per day. If you are overweight or tend to gain weight easily, consume two meals a day: breakfast and either lunch or dinner, plus two low-sugar (less than 5 grams) snacks with fewer than 100 calories each. If you are already at a normal weight, or if you tend to lose weight easily or are over 65 and of normal weight, eat three meals a day and one low-sugar (less than 3 to 5 grams) snack with fewer than 100 calories.</li>
<li>Confine all eating to within a twelve-hour period; for example, start after 8 a.m. and end before 8 p.m. Don’t eat anything within three to four hours of bedtime.</li>

<h2 id="do-not-skip-breakfast">Do not skip breakfast</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For people trying to lose weight or those who tend to be heavy, the best nutritional advice is to eat breakfast daily; have lunch or dinner, but not both; and substitute for the missed meal one snack containing fewer than 100 calories and no more than 3 to 5 grams of sugar. (Do not skip breakfast, as this has been associated with increased risk for age-related diseases in multiple studies.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-recipe-for-a-long-life">The Recipe for a long life</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Areas of the world known to have the highest prevalence of centenarians—Okinawa, Japan; Loma Linda, California; small towns in Calabria and Sardinia, Italy; and in Costa Rica and Greece—all share diets that are (1) mostly plant-based with lots of nuts and some fish; (2) low in proteins, sugars, and saturated/trans fats; and (3) high in complex carbohydrates coming from beans and other plant-based foods. Most of these centenarians ate only two or three times a day, ate light meals in the evening, and were in many cases done eating before dark.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="eat-low-protein-until-70-then-increase-with-20">Eat low protein until 70, then increase with 20%</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, maintaining a high-vegetable, low-protein diet for the first seventy or eighty years of life, and later switching to a diet richer in proteins but also animal-based foods like eggs, chicken, milk, and certain cheeses, may have slowed down aging and optimized the health of the Molochio centenarians. This explanation fits with our discovery that low-protein intake is associated with extended longevity and a major reduction in cancer in people age sixty-five and younger, but not in those above sixty-six.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="prolonged-caloric-restriction-is-not-beneficial-for-health">Prolonged caloric restriction is not beneficial for health</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>So, on the one hand we know that chronic caloric restriction can have profoundly beneficial effects on risk factors for many diseases. On the other hand, we know that chronic and extreme diets—diets that reduce calories by 20 percent or more and are maintained for long periods or permanently—can negatively affect necessary processes, including wound healing, immune response, and cold-temperature tolerance. Put simply, besides making a person extremely thin, the detrimental effects of chronic calorie restriction appear to minimize its benefits by causing a major increase in other types of diseases and conditions that are less well understood. The focus of the rest of this book is on how to obtain the remarkable beneficial effects of calorie restriction without the negative ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="epidemiology-low-protein-high-carb-plant-based-diets-are-healthiest">Epidemiology: low protein high carb plant based diets are healthiest</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Most large-population studies show an association between longevity and disease prevention, and a diet that is low in protein; largely plant- and fish-based; and rich in complex carbohydrates, olive oil, and nuts. For example, our epidemiological study of six thousand Americans suggested that consuming a high-protein diet is associated with increased levels of the pro-aging growth factor IGF-1 (see fig. 4.3), a 75 percent increased risk of overall mortality, and a three- to fourfold increased risk in cancer mortality compared with consuming the low-protein and plant-based diet recommended here (see fig. 4.4).12 Contrary to the findings of T. Colin Campbell in The China Study, which advocates consuming low levels of plant-based proteins throughout life, the beneficial effect of a low-protein diet seems to apply only before age sixty-five (fig. 4.3). A Harvard study of nearly 130,000 doctors and nurses also indicates that a low-carb diet high in animal fat and protein is associated with increases in overall cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality, a finding that is in agreement with our research.13 In line with our previous protein study, a follow-up study of the same group followed by Harvard University, in which I acted as a co-author, showed that consumption of high levels of animal but not plant-based proteins was associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease.14 A similar study of forty thousand men suggests that a low-carb, high-animal-protein diet is associated with a twofold increase in diabetes, a finding also consistent with our discovery in the six-thousand-person protein study.15 A number of other epidemiological studies consistently associate high IGF-1 levels in the bloodstream with an increase of twofold or more in the incidence of breast, prostate, and other cancer types.16 Because we know that protein consumption is the key regulator of IGF-1 levels and that animal-protein intake is usually associated with intake of saturated animal fats, these studies bolster the case for a link between cancer, diabetes, and high protein and saturated fat intake.Epidemiological studies also support the key role of nourishment in disease prevention, since populations with deficiencies in certain vitamins have been shown to have an increased incidence for a variety of diseases. For example, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk for diabetes and autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases.17</p>

      <title>Kipchoge&#39;s Diet And Calories: What Does The Fastest Marathon Runner In The World Eat?</title>
      <link>https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/kipchoge-marathon-diet/</link>

      <description>Kipchoge is a Kenyan long-distance runner who competes in the marathon and is regarded as the greatest marathon runner of all time. He follows a simple diet that consists mainly of rice, potatoes, porridge, beans, and ugali, a dense maize-flour porridge. He also eats homemade bread, local fruits and vegetables, some meat, and Kenyan tea with extra sugar. He drinks a lot of water (three litres) each day and avoids indulgent foods like steak, poultry, sausages, or French fries.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kipchoge is a Kenyan long-distance runner who competes in the marathon and is regarded as the greatest marathon runner of all time. He follows a simple diet that consists mainly of <strong>rice, potatoes, porridge, beans, and ugali</strong>, a dense maize-flour porridge. He also eats homemade bread, local fruits and vegetables, some meat, and Kenyan tea with extra sugar. He drinks a lot of water (three litres) each day and avoids indulgent foods like steak, poultry, sausages, or French fries. He sometimes takes mursik, a fermented milk, to aid digestion. Before his historic sub-two-hour marathon run in 2019, he had oatmeal for breakfast.</p>
<p>His diet is mostly plant-based and high in carbohydrates and low in fat. He eats at specific times during the day and sources most of his food locally from the Eldoret region, where he trains. He likes to have ugali with lean beef and some managu, an indigenous spinach-like vegetable, or with beans and potatoes. He also likes rice and red beans, or chapati, an unleavened flatbread. When he is travelling, he prefers pasta as his carbohydrate source.</p>
<p>He works closely with his longtime coach, Patrick Sang, who understands the importance of nutrition in achieving peak performance. His nutritionist Armand Bettonviel explained the importance of carbo-loading and why marathon runners need to avoid whole grain products. Kipchoge’s diet played a critical role in his record-breaking marathon runs, including his sub-two-hour marathon in Vienna in 2019, sponsored by INEOS, and his gold medal-winning performance at the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
<p>According to one source, Kipchoge eats around <strong>2,300 calories</strong> on a non-race day. This is far fewer than one might think for a marathon runner who trains at high intensity and volume. However, he also consumes over <strong>100 grams of carbohydrates per hour</strong> during his race, which is a very high amount. He uses a combination of drink mixes and gels that contain easily digestible carbohydrates and hydrogel technology. This helps him maximize his energy production and performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see that he eats a mainly plant based diet but still includes beef. I&rsquo;m also surprised by the high amount of carbohydrates. I&rsquo;m currently experimenting with a lower carb diet so that my body will tend to run more on fat while I&rsquo;m running, but I&rsquo;m intruiged by the fact that the world&rsquo;s fastest marathon runner is basically fueled on carbohydrates. It&rsquo;s even more surprising that he only eats around 2300 calories a day.</p>
